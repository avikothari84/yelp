All the servers and hosts were friendly and trying to accomodate us but for some reason they assumed we'd want to be there forever. I was trying to meet up with my family for a quick-ish lunch since they were around the area. They put in our name and it took over 20 min to get seated. They brought out appetizers- calamari (which was ok), the hummus platter (which was good), the tater tots (which are always delicious but somehow got way smaller since they 1st opened). It all took so long though that I had to excuse myself and get my actual food to-go. It turned into a 2 hour lunch for them and I'm glad I left when I did. I don't want to comment on the burger because it's never as good reheated but I do want to say the Kale/Brussel Sprouts Cole Slaw was actually really great! I think it would pop a little bit more with some radish though... just a suggestion.",

Their steak salad was extremely filling and delicious, with a white TRUFFLE vinaigrette and wild mushrooms.  If you like truffle, grilled flat iron steak, and salads, then this is the absolute perfect dish.\nAhi tacos + cocktail",

Went on a Saturday night with a couple of peoples.  We were a bit on a time crunch, so we were hoping to be in an out of the place in about an hour, tops.  The restaurant is located in dt culver city, so totally awesome, and not too far.  Walking is probably best, but there is a parking structure and some street parking.  Food here is tasty - def try the lamb burger and I'm always a sucker for fries.   This last visit though, it took FOREVER for the food to come out.  And I mean FOREVER.  BUT, at least someone came out, I think possibly the owner or manager, to apologize for the delay.  at least they came out to apologize to us in person.  I can respect that.\n\nbut food is pretty good, and awesome chill ambiance.",

The restaurant itself is super cute and seems like a fun place to come any night of the week. Our server Ryan was an absolute DOLL. So funny and sweet. Can he be my friend? He was patient with my annoying foodie friends' questions and recommended the Crushed Velvet (like a Moscow Mule) which was delish. I also had the beet salad and loved that too! The vibe was laid back and charming - perfect way to spend an evening catching up with friends. I may just come back before I head home ... Thanks to all!",

The HH menu is actually quite extensive. I believe it was $3 or $4 for HH beers & wells. There is a selection of food that ranges from $4-6. The only real problem here is finding a seat!! This place is ALWAYS packed!!! It's first come first serve and most of it is communal seating which can be annoying. You really have to be aggressive out there, no matter how big your group is. Finding a seat for 2 is tough, but any group greater than that is going to be nearly impossible unless you come right at 4.\n\nHH beers surprisingly included an IPA which was delish and a Venice Beach Beer which was awesome. Their other two HH beers were so-so and tasted like water in my opinion. BUt I'm a fan of big bold flavors and lots of hop so if you're into lighter beers these might be for you.\n\nHH food:\n- Chicken wings: OK. Comes plain w/ a selection of 3 sauces.\n- Nachos: Meh. Wouldn't order again. Salsa was weird and not enough cheese.\n- PB&J sliders: Good. Surprisingly good!! The habanero jam was def had a kick but the PB gave it the right amount of creaminess. It also comes with bits of bacon...so how could you go wrong??\n\nThis is a great place to come with friends (if you can find seats) and unwind. I really like the side-walk dining and the energy that comes with the place. Food could be better but overall not a bad place for drinks & eats.\nHH chicken wings\nPB&J sliders",

If you haven't seen YouTube videos of Real Actors Read Yelp Reviews, you just gotta cuz there are a couple of scathing reviews on here that I would just lurv to have read aloud in a dramatic monologue.  Like Sue Z's.  I can just imagine the robot voice now...ahahahaha!  Wait this is not where I parked my car...\n\nHonestly, Public School 310 has got it down.  Don't expect culinary marvel.  Come to be entertained.  Come to enjoy good, decent food.  And please don't act too cool for school.  Pouting like Victoria Beckham is just not a good look for you.\n\nThe team really thought about how to inject some fun into the ambiance and carried the school theme throughout the restaurant in delightful ways from the lines of microscopes on shelves, to the note pad ruled menus, to the fries served in brown paper sack bags.  Does it feel a bit manufactured?  You bet.  Does it feel like some Disney Imagineers designed the restaurant?  Uh huh - and I love it.  If you're like me, you'll find yourself chuckling with every new discovery and reminiscing with your party about your favorite fashion styles (now faux pas) from the 80s and 90s.  So kudos to PS 310 for thinking this through.\n\nOnto the food.  Not bad at all.  For a friendly neighborhood pub/bistro they do a darn good job and serve food that is waaaayyyyy better than what my school cafeteria offered up.  My burger was cooked perfectly to a nice medium.  Nice quality meat served with fresh sides.  Fries were adorably packaged in brown paper bags - I could have used a little more, but really, my ever expanding waistline actually thanks you for not doing that PS 310.  We were traveling 10 deep in our party during a packed lunch and the kitchen had no problems getting our orders out in no time.  Well done.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say that school is officially in session.  PS 310 is a welcome addition to what feels like a hum-drum Culver City strip.  Lunch bell or not, I plan on going back and so should you!",

Everything was delicious and well worth the $4-$6. They had four $4 beers on tap but I ordered a half liter of Pinot Grigio for only $10, and I was impressed. Almost finished it with help from the hubster! (I can only usually handle less than 1 glass of wine)!\n\nWe couldn't stop ordering more of these:\n1.The PB&J Sliders: these were my favorite~such an amazing flavor combination in a slider!\n2. The Parmesan truffle fries: love the huge pieces of Parmesan served on top\n3. Calamari: crispy and addictive. Not really that \"fiery\" IMO.\n\nSolid choices:\n1. Cheeseburger sliders\n2. Naked wings\n3. Albacore sashimi\n\nThis place will definitely be a favorite for my co-workers and me! Happy hour is from 4-7 but get there early!

I was excited to try out new spots in culver while I was in town and friends had made reservations (which took about 45-hour) upon getting seated in the outdoor patio, we got our menus. Ok, so yah, the menus are super cute, totally went with the theme of the name. Composition books & clipboards with wider ruled paper =adorable.\nFood all sounded delicious and we were excited to order.\n2 orders the hunters burger and 2 of us shared a salad with scallops, squash, curry etc and all wanted to share the calamari.\n10 min later \"we are out of calamari\" so he recommended the mac in cheese.\n\nWe got our food and it was not love and first bite, we all looked T each other and weren't impressed. Flavors did not match well. I am no ludo or gordon to judge but I just did not like it. I felt like my parents were at the table telling me to finish all food or I can't go outside to play, I was literally not tasting anything I enjoyed. Well, I lied, the french fries were good. Mac, had too much going on and I couldn't taste the cheese on the mac. My friend didnt even finish the burger, just took two bites. The after taste was weird.\nWill definitely try to give this spot another chance but definitely not ordering what we did last night.",

The service was very good.\n\nThere were many things I wanted to try so I asked our waiter for a recommendation. He suggested the shrimp and grits. My daughter tried the lamb burger.\n\nBoth dishes were really good.\n\nThe shrimp and grits had a lot of shrimp, the grits were creamy and it was full of flavor. It comes out in a cast iron dish and was very filling for me.\n\nThe burger was also flavorful and cooked well. It was not dry nor did it taste gamey like lamb can sometimes.\n\nUnfortunately we were both so full we didn't have room for dessert but since there will be a next time.......\n\nThey also have a nice full bar.",

When we checked in, we were seated right away, so lucky!\n\nWe were immediately welcomed by our server who was named Sarah?.. what a doll. She was so upbeat, what a pleasure!\n\nNow for the meal:\n\nI had the dragoons irish stout short rib ($24)\n-- now i think the short ribs were marinated in beer? unfortunently, when the dish came out, no one had drained the short ribs and they were literally swimming in a small pool of beer sauce? no real depth of flavor unfortunently, they were served over horseradish yukon mash and caramelized onion au jus, overall: just ok, nothing super memorable.\n\nThe hubby got the colorado lamb burger with matchstick fries ($15):\nhe actually liked it. I had a bite and thought it was too gamey, but he said thats what its suppose to taste like. he told me hed order it again.\n\nFarro & Brussel Salad ($6) : The best part of our meal!\na great portion of farro, brussels and butternut squash! Sprinkled with cranberries and crunchy pecans! Dressed with sweet curry vinaigrette! Fork licking good!!\n\noverall, despite the wonderful servce, its a little overpriced for the average quality of food you get IMO, not sure Ill go back..\nSee all photos from Giulianna N. for Public School 310",

The feel of the restaurant is pretty cool, it reminded me of being in elementary school all over again with the menu's that look like those composition books. Anyways, memories aside now.\n\nI ordered a burger and beer, I know, classic American meal. It was quite a good burger with a large size chunk of meat on it. The fries had a zesty hint of flavor to them. I didn't have room in my stomach to finish all the fries that came with the burger though. They had a really nice beer selection, not too extensive, but some great options nonetheless. The macaroni and cheese from the small plates or maybe it was appetizer menu was quite good as well.\n\nI would note that if you sit inside, expect it to be quite loud. I was quite surprised when I wandered into the inside to look for the restaurant. After that point, I was really glad that we got seated outside.\n\nOverall, a great option for someone that wants American food and a cool beer. Would definitely recommend it! :)",

The portions are on the smallish side, so ordering an appetizer has been a must for me.    \n\nI ordered the Bangers and Mash when I ate here yesterday, because I wanted to try something different. The flavor of the entire plate surpassed my expectations.  The only thing that diminished the entr\u00e9e for me was that the portion was too small.  I was not filled at all, so I ordered the bacon cheddar tots after.  They were ok.  They were slightly overcooked, and lacked the flavor that I would have expected.  The outsides were too crispy, and the inside seemed a bit raw.  Even though I was still super hungry I could only eat a few.\n\nThe food menu here is pretty small, but they do have many craft beer offerings. They only have a few cocktails on the menu, and I went with the Jungle Juice last night. It was on the strong side and left me feeling pretty buzzed afterwards.  The punch that they used didn't mesh well with the alcohol and the flavor tasted off.  The drink was not bad, but I do think it could have been mixed better.\n\nI have been to Public School 310 a couple of times so far, and it just doesn't seem worth it to me.  The food is overpriced, and many of the drinks can be found elsewhere.  It was worth a couple of visits, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  This is one hype train that I wouldn't mind not riding.",

Sure enough...another 20 minutes go by and here comes all the food...with the appetizer. (Wtf)\nOur waiter must have checked on us once. We had no utensils and had to flag him down so some of us could eat.\nI had the \"moody burger\". Nothing special, it's just a  bland burger on a nice bun and 1/4 of a cup of blue cheese and a hand full of fries.\nAlso, those wings are NOT WORTH TWELVE DOLLARS! For 6 wings???\nRock&Brews sells the best Asian style spicy wings with fresh minced garlic glazed with this amazing sauce. They serve you 8 to 10 wings for the same price. So ridiculous.\nIf the food was AMAZING I could deal with shitty service. The only enjoyable thing were the fries. Which I had to order more because once again we got skimped out on fries.\nThen the bill comes out to over $100 for bland burgers, small amount of fries, bad service, no utensils and a waiter that chills behind the bar chatting it up with his friends that came to visit.\nWe were planning on having a get together here and pay for everything up front so our guest can just order as they please but it's obviously not something that would be enjoyable.\nI also found it kind of rude that if a customer is walking in or out of the restaurant, the waiters cut right past them as they are in the middle of walking thru that door, almost as if they didn't see them. Just wait! Or hold the door open for your guest if anything.\nDon't waste your money people. Mediocre food for prices that aren't worth the wait. Literally.",

First off we waited about 20 minutes for a table which is totally fine! But once they sat us we waited for about 8 minutes before anyone even acknowledge us. Can I get you something to drink, my name is blah blah be with you guys in a minute. Nothing!!! So while we are waiting there 3 servers are behind us laughing and talking with each other. Not cool. Especially being a waitress myself.\n\nSo we finally got someone to come over and I asked a few questions about the menu he got us some water we ordered an appetizer. The appetizer arrived we ate it and finished it sat there for another 5 minutes after we finished it and still the server has not came back to take our order or check on us.\n\nSo he comes back takes our order, my fianc\u00e9 got the lamb burger which he loved!!! I got the short rib with mashed potatoes that had horseradish in them, which I might add that I asked if I could have it without the horseradish and he said yes! So I was happy about that. Well the food finally got there and my mashed potatoes had horse radish in them. I had to flag down our server to let him no and he went to the kitchen and I guess I can't have them without the horse radish. I was disappointed that the server did NOT ask that question why would you say yes about something you're not sure of. So he didn't seem to care very much. A manager didn't come over and apologize nothing was really said. Safe to say I will not return here again.\nDirty knife, pretty gross",

It didn't taste of nothing-but-pumpkin. I really enjoyed the velvety and not as thick topping.\nMy scallop and shaved sprout salad was a little too sweet, but a decent helping...of salad. I had only 4 scallops. Technically, two, as they had been cut in half. They weren't overwhelmingly thick to begin with, so this was disappointing.

It was expected since it's one of the newer spots out in downtown Culver, taking over the space that used to be Fraiche. We had a bit of a wait for our table, so we checked in with the hostess and walked over to Bottle Rock around the corner for a drink. The host was nice enough to give us a call when our table was about ready.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the Kale Caesar salad with grilled salmon and Steak with chimichurri sauce. Both were fantastic. I'm usually not a huge fan of caesar salads for fear of an overly-anchovy dressing, but this one was great. Paired with the trendy decor and 'hip' crowd, not a bad night out.\n\nI'd say service was fine, with nothing out of the ordinary to note. Street parking available or try the free structure on Cardiff.\nSee all photos from Wendy A. for Public School 310",

                  "review": "Weirdest, WEIRDEST EXPERIENCE ... here's the simple version: my co-workers and I walked over to have lunch there. The door was open so we went in. It was about 11:20am. We were told by the first guy we encountered - who seemed totally thrown by our arrival - that they didn't open until 11:30. That was just 10 minutes away so we said we could sit and wait until they were actually opened. Though this idea seemed to unnerve him, I guess it was ok, so we went outside, where the girl who was shuffling through menus seemed just as put out by our presence... my boss asked if we could get some ice teas which again, seemed to cause shockwaves of discomfort and confusion. Another guy brought them out to us ... and we waited and chatted, at this point, maybe 7 minutes to go... Meanwhile another couple arrived prior to the 11:30 official open time, then another couple with a stroller, both tables seated in our area.. then it was 11:30. So this same girl walks behind us and hands menus to the table with the stroller, then the second couple who came in after us, then swung by our table and literally (read: LITERALLY) FLUNG them on the edge of the table, wordlessly ... that was our cue. We didn't stay.... it was the most insane near-animosity from the entire staff! One after the other!? We were done.\n\nSo here's how that SHOULD have gone if any ONE of the vacant, clueless staff we encountered had had an ounce of customer service abilities: \"Hi. We don't open for another 10 minutes but you're welcome to take a seat\" .. then, I don't know, maybe brought us menus so that we'd be ready to order after the 10 minutes passed... and maybe acknowledge at that all-important 'stroke of 11:30' \"Hey, thanks for waiting...etc, etc...\" but none of these thoughts seemed to enter the heads of anyone we encountered. My co-workers and I said to each other \"if even ONE of them had said the right thing, the professional thing, made us feel welcome, \"we'll be right with you, thanks for waiting, here are the specials\" -- ANYTHING other than the \"God, I wish these people didn't come into this business establishment to try to pay us money for services\"... SO, SO WEIRD! I don't think I can even convey to you how weird and unsettling the whole thing was ... if I didn't know better I'd SWEAR we were on some hidden camera shows where the staff were really actors pretending to be incompetent ...my office of hundreds is within walking distance to Public School and this could easily be a lunchtime destination for us but not after THAT craziness .... oh and the food? Could be amazing! We'll never know, will we...?\nUseful 4\nFunny\nCool\nGrill Concepts Team\nBusiness Manager\n11/9/2016\nBrian,\n\nI am sorry to hear about your strange experience.

                  "review": "After 12 years of hard time in San Francisco public schools, plus two years at CCSF where textbook prices then seemed shocking, my farewell to the school district included a resolution to never return in any capacity.\n\nThen why would I ever consider stepping into a Culver City establishment by the name of Public School No. 310?  Well, just like in the old days, peer pressure.\n\nThe food at PS 310 is much more palatable than at SFUSD cafeterias of yore, but exponentially more expensive, and not without its faults.  Further, it's a full bar but, with draft beer starting at $6, it gets prohibitive, compared to prohibited in school.\n\nTwo co-diners had fish (not fish sticks) and chips ($15) that looked splendid, served with abundant fries.  Another ordered the offspring of yesteryears' \"cook's surprise\"--summer market pasta with roasted chicken--that I got to sample and found impressive, but at $19 it was, er, fully priced.  It helps to know before you get de-pantsed and surrender your lunch money that you'll first enjoy a satisfying repast.\n\nMy roasted poblano with quinoa ($14) was an unbattered chile relleno with tasty filling.  The side of bland cilantro-lime rice was served lukewarm in a much-hotter ceramic dish on the dinner plate.  Our foursome's class clown, unsolicited by me, pop-quizzed our charming server about what temperature the rice was supposed to be.  She responded, \"Um, kind of warm?\" Epic PASS:  That's exactly what it was.\n\nLesson:  In restaurants nowadays, lukewarm is becoming the new hot.\nSchool's out.",

My reason for 4 stars would be the selections for brunch. I was hoping there would be a lot more choices, but there weren't. I'll definitely go back, bottomless mimosas for 15 bucks not a bad deal either.",

The other times everything was fine, not awesome but not bad.\n\nThe food is very good, atmosphere is nice but when you are charging as much as you for food and drink, you expect a certain level of service. Maybe it was an off night but our server rushed us repeatedly and wouldn't make an effort to clear the plates, and was downright unpleasant. When everyone in your party starts to comment on how not nice the server is, and everyone is easy-going and pleasant when they started the dinner, it's just not cool to be a dick. If you don't like your job, quit. But don't make nice people suffer for no reason.\n\nAs far as food - the ahi tacos, deviled eggs, and the short rib plate were delicious. The calamari was fine, but nothing too special. Their fries are really good - thin with some skin. Honey mustard sauce really tangy.\n\nAlso, make sure you wait or reserve(don't know if you can) a four top if you don't want to sit at a communal table.",

Pointed out to the lady bartender that the drinks tasted like \"plain juice\", she asked if we wanted doubles (double the price as well) and seemed completely annoyed, wasn't really polite, almost rude! Not really the type of attitude to keep people at the bar. Will definitely try other spots downtown Culver City before coming back here.\nGreat deco, very library-ish -- with booze!",

Beer selection was too average for being a craft beer gastropub (25 on tap). $65 for a bison burger, reuben sandwich, mac and cheese (hamburger helper) plus one beer (golden money) seemed too rich. The mac & cheese at $11-12 was in the \"for the table\" section so I was expecting enough to share with others but the portion size was underwhelming. Sharing with two people was basically like handing out scraps. I also wouldn't recommend the mac & cheese, it was basically beef stroganoff (hamburger helper). They try to fancy sauce everything. The ketchup had siracha in it and something was also going on with their ranch. Golden Monkey is a good beer when you consider that it's $10-11 for a sixer at 9.5 ABV but practically a boner killer at $9 a glass for something available everywhere. Not even special tap nights like pliny gouge that much. Beer and food was too expensive for what it was but the two sandwiches did taste good. The only plus was that it was one of the only places open in the area until midnight. That's the only real reason we gave the place any consideration.",

We arrived 15 minutes early and were offered a table outside but opted to wait until our reservation time so we could sit inside .. It was too cold for outdoor seating. After waiting 15 minutes we were taken inside to our table and the restaurant was half empty .. a little puzzling why we couldn't be seated when we arrived.\n\nOur waiter was awesome, very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He was the type of guy that you knew he wasn't BS'in you about his \"personal favorite\" item menu. Unfortunately, our waiters shift ended just after he brought us drinks and the guy who replaced him was horrible. No communication and a bad attitude, I was particularly upset when he asked if he could take away my plate and had proceeded to do so before i could get \"NO\" out of my mouth. He placed it back down without an apology, or any words spoken for that matter.\n\nTo the food: The appetizers were a lot better than the entrees. Our first waiter recommended them and he wasn't wrong. I had Bangers & Mash for my entree. The mash potato was dry and unappealing. I basically ate some sausage and left the rest.\n\nThe decor is nice, and the ambiance is good too. I would probably go back for drinks and appetizers, nothing more. I'm sorry I can't remember our first waiters name, he definitely deserves a shout out .. he was the guy who recently went to Europe!",

Sausage was delicious and potatoes were very flavorful, it's a generous portion FYI.\n- PB & J cookies & milk - really enjoyed the nostalgic flavors, very simple.",

I had booked a reservation and made a note requesting a table with chairs because I worry as a big girl I won't fit in a booth. Anyway, that wasn't brought to anyone's attention and was clearly taken care of so I was at ease from the start. I was sat right away prior to arrival of whole party which isn't common these days and server came right away to bring me a cocktail. I was so pleased with clear description of beer list and the vodka, blackberry, blueberry ginger beer drink was to die for! We had buffalo cauliflower, dynamite! The bacon and cheese tater tots, we died so yummy!!!! AND the pretzel, the mustard served was the perfect pairing, sweet and the salty, nothing over powering.  I am always interested when I see fish and chips on the menu and while I was planning on the Bison burger because of decadent picture on website I ordered the fish, it was awesome!!! Their take of tarter sauce was everything along with their spicy ketchup. My sister had the southwest chicken bowl that was shockingly a great portion of healthy and delicious, I felt bad she didn't stick with my fried 'theme' I will be back to have that for lunch for sure.  The atmosphere was great, it was crazy busy but you would never know it, no crazy noise and our server was super kind and open and always on top of whatever we needed. While filled to the brim, of COURSE we HAD to order the Nutella ice cream sandwich, shared by 4 who all said maybe they could have 1 bite..... we fought over who would lick the plate apparently we all found room.  and while in a bit of a food coma on my couch now, all worth it. This is an A+ experience and I totally recommend! I have heard there is a location closer to my home in Sherman Oaks, I only hope their staff is as good as the one in Culver City. I look forward to finding out.",

                  "review": "On a whim, we headed to Culver City with friends of ours for drinks at the Culver Hotel, a movie at the Arclight and then dinner somewhere afterward.  We wandered around a bit and I saw this place.  I had heard many good things about the Public School in Sherman Oaks but had not been yet.  So I convinced my companions that we should try it out.  The place was packed but we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, which wasn't so bad.  They only got busier while we were there so I was glad it did not take me long to convince my crew to wander over there.  I would recommend making reservations, though!\nThe food here is great!  If only the food back in Public School was anything like this.  They have a great theme going: all throwbacks to your youth as a kid in school.  The menus are in Composition Booklets, the tables and decor are made with reclaimed wood and furniture (probably from actual public schools); the wall behind us was either made from the old accordion bleachers that pull out of the wall or made to look like them.  The service was great, too!  The vibe is very energetic; everyone is having a great time.  \nWe started with the Calamari, Brussels Sprouts and the Buffalo Cauliflower - all delicious!  We loved them.  I then had the Salmon, which was also good, very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  \nThe Bison Burger and the Thai Chicken Noodle salad were other memorable favorites at the table.  \nThey have a happy hour on Fridays from 3 - 7 PM, which I gather is very popular.  \nA couple notes of complaint: they were participating in the DINE LA Restaurant Week but we were not offered the Dine LA Menu.  I only discovered this on the way out as I noticed several tables with the Dine LA Menus.  That was disappointing because I do so enjoy the Dine LA week and had I known, would have partaken.  Oh well.\nThe other issue is that they are part of the Grill Concepts Restaurant company (including the other Public Schools, The Daily Grills, The Points, etc.) and I noticed an advertisement on the table to get a free appetizer if we signed up for their rewards program.  So I asked our waiter for a pen and I filled out the application and handed it back to him indicating that I would like to join the program and take advantage of the offer.  He said okay but he never took one of the appetizers off of our bill.  I was going to mention it but was told, \"Let's not be that table, just forget about it and use it next time\" so I let it go.  However, it has been a couple weeks or so and I have never received a confirmation email, nor is my information recognized on the Grill Concepts website so I have no idea what our waiter did with my application.  Oh well.\nI now want to try the Public School 818 and 213.  We'll see if they are on par with 310.",

                  "review": "I have gone to Public School 310 now at least 10 times to pick up lunch for work.  I have never had a worse pick-up experience (aside from the other times I've picked up from this same place).  I will call an hour in advance and every time I confirm that they will be able to have it ready at a certain time.  They have never been less than 10 minutes late with the order.  This past time they were 38 minutes late!!!!  \nI literally could have placed my order when I got there and it would have been ready sooner.  It was three meals.  The hostess had an attitude when I asked if she would mind checking on the order about 20 minutes into the wait.  I finally asked to speak with the manager who laughed as said, \"wow, that took forever!\"  \n\nIt's not only the wait and the poor customer service and attitudes of the staff, there has only been one time that the order was as I asked.  ALWAYS double check the orders.  They almost always don't give the right amount of sides and a few times they haven't done the modifications people requested.  \n\nIt is understandable that a restaurant could be running behind.  Even a 15 minute wait is understandable.  But when it's average 25-30 minutes after the time THEY suggested, that's not cool.  \n\nMy co-workers (sometimes up to 14 meals!) and I have decided we are never taking our business there again.",

Walking around downtown Culver City, we saw Public School 310 and we decided to try it out.\n\nWhile dining here, we sat at the bar and the bartenders were awesome - great service, wish I remembered their names. I had a Moscow Mule along with their Shrimp and Grafton Cheddar Grits. The food and drink were both sooooo good! Definitely not something you want if you're looking for a healthy option, but oh my gosh it was so delicious.",

But, Public School is an excellent choice for Dates, Groups or just wanting to have good food and drinks.  The theme of course is School.  They have globes and books as decor, and a menu composition book as the menu.  Very nice details.  Really nice spot.\n\n::::::::::SERVICE::::::::::\n\nService was spotty.  They were busy, yes.  But there were long gaps inbetween sitting and ordering.  Could be better.\n\n::::::::::FOOD::::::::::\n\n- Crispy Ahi Tacos - jicama avocado salsa, ponzu, lemon aioli, crispy wonton shells.\nPerfect way to start your meal.  You get four Tacos.  I hate when places give you odd numbers in food items.  The tang from the citrus is the perfect way to dress the tacos.  Love it.\n\n- Colorado Lamb Burger ($16) - tomato cranberry jam, arugula, brie, brioche bun.  OK,  I ordered my burger Medium (as I do most of my meat, except Chicken),  The burger came out on a warm buttery Brioche Bun with perfect shoestring fries.  I asked for the Tomato Cranberry Jam on the side.  I wasnt for sure if I was going to like it on my burger. Im glad I did.  Somehow I ended up trying the Mashed Peas from my dates plate on my burger and it was AMAZING.  OMG it really made the burger.  Order a side of the Mashed Peas instead of the Jam.\n\n- Beer Battered Fish & Chips - cod, r\u00e9moulade sauce, malt vinegar, sriracha ketchup.\nI didn't taste too much of it, but from what I did have it was yummy.  The Sriracha Ketchup was a great addition.\n\nI had a glass of $9 Tempranillo which was very nice.",

My friends and I shared the bacon and cheddar tots and calamari which were really good. Both appetizers were crispy and the dipping sauces they came with were delicious.\n\nThe pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, however, was definitely my lamb burger with red quinoa. The quinoa was fresh and light. The lamb burger was perfectly cooked and the creamy brie was balanced out with the sweetness of the tomato cranberry jam. It's definitely a must!\n\nI only tried their violet berries cocktail, but it was so tasty I actually ordered a second one.\n\nAll in all, yes, the place is very busy but it is new. I would recommend making a reservation and you get seated right away.\n\nCan't wait to go again!",

And once again a great server with just the right amount of enthusiastic school spirit.\n\nBrought out some of these awesome bacon cheddar tater tots to start.  Wow.  Fresh shredded potatoes melded with cheddar and bacon bits, deep fried to a crispy texture on the outside but soft and so gooey good on the inside.  I'll skip recess for these.\n\nGot the Huntsman Burger again.  Figured lets see if they can do a better job cooking this correctly.  And what do you know students, they nailed it to the chalkboard this time!  I ordered medium well and it was perfect.  Just a touch pink in the middle.  Now this ranks as one of the top burgers in L.A.!  Even at this level of done-ness it was super juicy.  Nicely charred.  Did I say great flavor?  I'll say it again just in case you couldnt hear me in this super loud restaurant.  Great seasoning and flavors in what you can tell is very fresh meat, ground in house they say. That is how to achieve a \"doctorate\" in burger mastering.   Blend of the balslamic onions, lettuce ,thick cut tomato and of course the very pungent Huntsman cheese to cut through it all.  Perfect Brioche bun with the right bun to meat ratio.  Give the superintendant a raise!\n\nGot a great side faro and brussel salad.  Butternut squash, cranberries, pecans I think. This had  super fresh and balanced flavors. Very creative and perfectly done.  Bravo.\n\nFriend got the poblano chile which he said was spicy but loved.  Had a very meat like taste and texture but no meat.  Veggie students rejoice!  Also the Kale ceasar salad.  Great ceasar dressing.  Tart and fresh.  A real anchovy perched on top.  A very nice different take on a ceasar that was another A+.\n\nDown it all with some great craft beers they school you on and now you have a 5 star experience.  So maybe my complaints of a raw burger got them to fire the janitor or p.e. teacher who made it the first time and put the star professor on the broiler who showed me what cooking right is all about.\n\nI'm ready for my \"higher education\" now...\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool\n1/21/2013Previous review\nWe got schooled on how not to cook food.  Two stars is generous based on our one meal.  Our server was great that is why I'm going 2 stars.\n\nPlace is packed.  Place is super loud.  Be warned.  You will be hoarse after a meal of almost yelling to be heard, but that seems to be the norm these days for the new hip places.  \n\nLiked the menu.  But of course on a first trip went with the burger.  But before the main event we had a couple of very good beers.  Nice description on the menu helped the decision and they were pretty accurate which is being \"schooled\" I guess.  \n\nCauliflower Gratin app.  This would or could have been a \"10\" if only the cauliflower would have been seasoned and roasted .  Instead it was just steamed little pieces in a melted cheese with some bacon bits on top.  Not bad , but not special.  Oh well.\n\nThe burger.  This again could have been a \"top 5\" pick burger if only it was cooked right.  It's big (I'm guessing 1/2 pound) and had a great seasoning.  Excellent brioche bun crunchy grilled bottom with garlic butter.  Now thats how to show the pupils what to do with a bunster.   Nice.  Super carmelized onions. Again.  Students, pay attention.  Carmelize things and they become awesome.   And huntsman cheese which is like a very sharp british cheddar.  If you want cheese, make it a strong one so it cuts through the other flavors. \"A+\" Excellent.  Good fresh fries and quinoa salad which was very fresh and tasty.  Side dishes bring your grades up so always do that homework kiddies.\n\nSo what went wrong students of  food?   Well one burger was ordered medium and came out medium rare.  The other burger was ordered medium well and came out, RARE.  I mean really rare!.  How about RAW. See my picture.  Now this is one of those places that the servers dont write down the order.  This is a huge joke in my book.  Only will lead to mistakes.  Could you remember a table of 4's 8 dishes with customized tweaks without writing it down.   No frickin way!  Its a major grade of \"F\" for \"foolish way to run a place\".  So maybe the burgers got switched by the kitchen or the server typed them in wrong.  Either way they were both cooked wrong and one was inedible.  Problem was I was so damn hungry I wolfed down half my burger which tasted great before I realized it was mooing and bunch of raw meat .   Then my brain hit the brakes and recess hit my eating and I cut class and didnt come back for more even though offered another one.  And they did take it off the bill which of course is the right thing for the principal to do.",

It's cute-strange, but casual and comfortable, with excellent food that easily overcomes the gimmicky theme. My dinner companions and I shared grilled artichokes, steak tacos, a BBQ bison burger, and deviled eggs. . . everything was delicious! Especially the steak tacos, they were perfect exactly the way they came from the kitchen without us needing to add sauce or other goop at the table. Maybe once a year I give compliments to the chef. This is my kudo for 2018. The server told me the grill-chef is Jonny Minton, and he surely has a gift. The service was fast, and all the orders were correct. Public School is noisy in a nice way. Some of the tables are communal. Everything is designed to look very low-key school house, but silverware wrapped in linen is a clue that the kitchen is serious. Dinner (shared by three people) was two appetizers, two entrees, beer, dessert, and tip for $90. Totally worth it!\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\nRandy N.\nBusiness Owner",

I ordered a cocktail, the Shrub,  and a beer, Smog City saison - enjoyed both quite a lot. Lots of choices for a variety of tastes.\n\nMy two quibbles for the evening was a rather long wait to place and sort of order - I think there was a missing server that evening. They were super friendly and on it as our meal progressed - it was just that initial wait. And secondly, it is quite loud. We were there on St. Patrick's Day, so you know, I'm not really complaining. I noticed however, that the planks of wood that act as shelves and separate the booths bounce sound from the next table directly into your area. So, you know, don't go there for a private convo - or request to not sit in a middle booth.\n\nAll in all - fantastic meal and experience and I can't wait to go back.",

My words to her- \"I guess that leaves every order open to the luck of the draw\". I literally came across one bit of bacon in the 4 tots I ate.\n\nI think the menu is interesting.

The server was very friendly and professional, taking our orders and promptly bringing drinks.\nHowever, almost 30 minutes went by and no food. Finally when we got (from a second server, who informed us he had been on a break) it that was cold. Thus we imagine that our food was seating for a while... The tacos were actually sushi! The steak salad was not done medium as requested. The salmon & veggies was also cold.\nThis second server was very nice, offering to exchange the tacos for something else, and even the salad, but we were so starved that we cut the bloody pieces off from the steak and ate the ends of it with the greens.\nNever coming back here... what a disappointment!",

Parked in a lot on Cardiff Ave (first 2 hours free)\n\nSERVICE: 5++ stars. Our waitress, Jennifer, was THE BOMB.COM. We accidentally showed up before PS310 opened, and she offered to let us inside for a quick coffee. When we couldn't decide what beer to daydrink with, she brought samples of all 4 $4 specials and gave us feedback on popular dishes. Throughout our long lunch, she popped by often with a goofy/good-natured remark.  \n\nFOOD: 5 stars. So scrumptious, and there's tons more I didn't get to try! I got the CCB (chicken burger with everything that's in a cobb salad, including a fried egg). My friend got the MUSTARD-GLAZED SCOTTISH SALMON with edamame fried rice and loved it too. We had a lot of trouble deciding because everything on the menu sounds delicious, but our server Jennifer helped us out.\n\nDRINK: 4.5 stars. Glad I got to sample HANGAR 24 \"ORANGE WHEAT\", BIG SKY BREWING CO. \"MOOSE DROOL\", and two others I can't remember.\n\nNOTE: I came here 2/22/2013 so this review is a bit late! But I know I'll be back!\nSchool-themed menu, table settings!",

The place only had about 20 customers and it took a minute for the hostess to show up. On the way in, she let go of the door and nearly hit my girlfriend with it.  Our server took our order & brought back our appetizer, but didn't bring extra plates. Afterwards she brought our food without clearing the dirty dishes. The plates were on the table the entire time. When we finished eating, about 10-15 minutes had past and she never checked on us once. I literally had to go get the server from the back to ask for a check and a to go plate. When she brought the check, she didn't clear the table, ask how the food was,  or seem to care that she ignored us the entire time.\nBison burger",

I had the jidori brick chicken and everyone raved how it was the best thing on the menu.. I'd have to disagree, while the chicken was juicy and quite tasty, everything it came with was just bleh, there weren't any particular flavors that were remarkable. I would come back though because there were some things on the menu I was intrigued by.\n\nWe also got the peanut butter and jelly dessert which was a peanut butter cookie, ice cream and a blackberry drizzle. From the photo you can tell that it was kind of a mess. It was completely frozen but when I was able to get some of the ice cream and cookie together it was quite great. The server told us it wasn't supposed to be frozen and even comped the dessert which was awesome. Definite a+ for standing behind your product and service!\nThe pb & j dessert.. A peanut butter cookie, ice cream & blackberry drizzle. It was frozen so it'll take a bit of manpower.\nUseful 3\nFunny\nCool\n6/6/2014Previous review\nNow, I have never actually been here for dinner so this is completely a 5 star rating for their new Night School event.\n\nWe went to the IPA 101 beer pairing dinner hosted by Stone Brewing Co. It was seriously amazing, the chef paired 5 bbq dishes to 5 of the Stone Brewing Co beers. This was probably one of my favorite dinners I've had since being back in LA and everything was phenomenal.\n\nWe had everything from whiskey rubbed prawns to smoked kielbasa to tri tip sandwiches to ribs with grilled corn to the best dessert I have probably ever had in my life-- a chocolate nut bar with vanilla bean ice cream. Now let me talk about this bar, it crumbled in my mouth, I was scraping the pan for more.. I'm not a dessert person, I love ice cream but I don't really eat cakes, cupcakes, you know all the typical desserts,  but i fell in love at first bite!\n\nThese nights are seriously cool and the manager was talking about doing it more often, everyone on staff that night knew exactly what they were talking about and more importantly could talk intelligently about what they were serving and why it was paired with the beer.",

                  "review": "Public School 310 is a great place to grab some awesome, flavorful appetizers, get a great burger, get boozy with some awesome cocktails/beers and indulge in some thoughtfully-crafted dessert.\n\nThe menu has a great selection of creative, upscale bar food. Here are the highlights:\n- Great appetizer selection. Hard to go wrong here. Bacon cheddar tots, Fiery Calamari and The Cutting Board were all incredible.\n- The Colorado Lamb Burger is amazing -- definitely get it medium or medium rare\n- Ask what their dessert special is -- if the PB&J Ice Cream pie is on the menu, GET IT\n- Wonderful cocktails/drink selection -- Tito's Sunset is spectacular\n- Cool ambiance\n- They take reservations, so you don't have to wait if you plan ahead\n\nPublic School 310 has a great, well thought-out menu. The two times I've been, I always find myself just wanting to order everything on the appetizer menu. None of the entrees really jump out at me, aside from the lamb burger, but I'm always tempted to order all the appetizers.\n\nLike I mentioned, the bacon cheddar tots are awesome -- they were hot, salty, crisp, bacon-y and satisfying.\n\nThe Fiery Calamari has a good amount of seasoning to it. It's not spicy per se, but has a slight, lingering heat to it. The ginger aioli is zippy, creamy and flavorful.\n\nThey've also got one of the best meat & cheese boards I've had. There's a wide selection of things to try -- the truffle goat cheese and caramelized onions were my stand-out faves. But the whole board is definitely great (especially at the price they're giving it to you for).\n\nThe Tito's Sunset cocktail certainly goes down easy. Delicious -- I loved the strawberry, the vodka and the prosecco for a bit of fizz. They also had a blackberry cocktail special which was also yummy.\n\nThe Colorado Lamb Burger (cooked medium) with fries, and it's definitely got that lamb-y, juicy flavor you crave. My first visit here, it came out well done by mistake, but the second go-around was perfect, so I'm glad I came back and gave it another shot. I love the sweetness of the tomato jam, coupled with the meaty lamb and creamy brie. Perfection. The fries aren't anything special, but their great selection of appetizers and sides should keep your munchies at bay.\n\nLastly, be sure to ask if they have any dessert specials. I was able to try a PB&J Ice Cream Pie dessert that was to-die-for. Perfectly sweet, tart and creamy. It had great texture, and was huge enough to share!\n\nThis is a great spot to hang out, grab a bite, have some drinks, watch a game. Definitely make a reservation if you can! I'll be coming back for more.",

I've only ordered from their rotating draft list and haven't been disappointed yet.\n\n+ Ample amount of seating both inside and outside.  Can get crowded, but the crowd comes in waves, so you won't have much trouble snagging a table or seats at the bar.\n\n- Understaffed on the weekends.  Only two bartenders and one hostess for a Friday night from what I recall the last time I was here.  Now, two bartenders wouldn't have been a problem if they could handle it, but they couldn't.\n\n- Don't want to call the bartenders inexperienced, but it sure as hell looked like they were struggling to keep up with the customers' orders.  One guy was taking his sweet time making cocktails that when he finished, he seemed overwhelmed by the amount of orders that came in.  The other chick couldn't pour beer to save her life, specifically leaving the glass there while she ran the tap and walked away.  Big no no.  My Old Rasputin was overflowing and half of the glass was foam.  When I tried to get a repour, all I received was distain.  No tip for you, bitch.\n\nAverage.  I like Public School a lot, but the vibe at DTLA is much more inviting.  Rather hit up that location than this one.  Sorry, Culver City.",

The only thing keeping it from getting a full 5 stars was the customer service. The waiter I experienced was not engaging at all and came off as really passive aggressive. Not to mention he didn't get to our table until 10-15 minutes after we sat down, the place wasn't even busy. I would totally provide a name but he didn't have the curtesy enough to tell me that. So the rating solely goes to the food because the Kale Cesar Salad w/ roasted chicken was great! Major applause to whomever the chef is.

Somehow, I had never been there, though I kept meaning to try it based on its reputation.\n\nMy wife and I stopped in there for a Sunday night dinner after a workshop around the corner.  We both looked at each other and decided it was one of the most disappointing meals we can remember in quite a while.\n\nThe drink selection looked promising and our choices of beer and wine were good, but those obviously came from outside sources.\n\nWe split the Irish short rib and the fish & chips.  The mashed potatoes served with the short rib were supposed to be laced with horseradish that the waiter promised would \"open your sinuses\".  They were truly the blandest things we've tasted since instant mashed potatoes our mothers made from a box.  At least the gravy gave a hint of flavor to the meat.  The fish was over-battered, over-cooked and tasteless.  On an up note, the mediocre fries were served with an interesting aioli, the highlight of the meal.\n\nOur server, as charming as he tired to be, failed to bring the malt vinegar he had offered and by the time we chased him down the fish and chips were cold.\n\nAfter all these years, I think we haven't missed anything by \"skipping School\" and have gotten a better culinary education elsewhere.",

It was a really nice day, so we decided to sit outside. Service was friendly, and the food was absolutely delicious! I got a chicken burger with avocado, bacon, and a fried egg on top. How bomb does that sound? The burger came with a side of fries too that I basically devoured on the spot. A lot of the prices here were a little too high for my liking, but this burger was pretty reasonable for all that was included. I definitely recommend it if you're going for lunch.\n\nOne thing that I didn't like was how close all the tables were to each other. I was basically listening to the couple beside me the whole time, and the waiter had a hard time giving us our food because there wasn't that much space between tables. This is purely based on the outside seating.",

My cousin and I just made it in the nick of time (it's from 4-7, got there 6:50) to put in our order and miraculously catch two open seats at the table top after a couple left.\n\nWe ordered the $7 ahi tacos, $5 chicken sausage, $4 Parmesan truffle fries, and the $4 farro sprout salad. All arrived fairly quick, the salad coming out almost right after we ordered it. The exception was the ahi tacos, which they had actually forgotten so we asked after we had finished eating everything else. But I didn't mind, saved the best for last.\n\nOverall, the waiters/waitresses and bartenders are all very friendly with good service. (FYI. Parked at the nearby parking structure around the corner on Cardiff. Free for the first two hours and additional 2 hrs free w/ validation and $1 for every additional hour I believe. Was there for over two hours, so I had to pay a dollar since I forgot validation.",

Depending on the time of day you arrive, there's almost always a wait unless you're willing to sit at the bar, but I've never waited longer than 30 minutes for a table - which is fine if you'd like to start off with a drink.\n\nThe Bacon Cheddar Tots are a good starter and some of their draft beers are pretty good, \"The Cutting Board' is their cheese-and-meat appetizer which is decent and the Huntsman is an average burger that won't disappoint. At first glance Public School seems hip and cheap (don't get me wrong, I like it here) but after a few appetizers or meals and 1-2 drinks per person, you're quickly in the $70-80 range, pre-tip.\n\nCheck out the menu before you go, try a few of the unique dishes, but definitely get there early if you don't like massive crowds.",

                  "review": "Updated review\nI had written a review about a bad experience I had at PS310 and expected to NEVER set foot in there again. Shortly after I posted my review, the current Manager, Jonny, (who was not the manager when I had my horrible experience, apparently) sent me a note asking me to let him make things right. He told me to come back with friends and he would \"take care of [me].\" I was surprised by the gesture. I honestly didn't think they would care about one bad review, but he said they take customer satisfaction seriously and want to make things right. I told him that I would email him the next time I planned to come in. I was excited to give this place another chance because my first experience was so great. He said they had fired the bartender that was a beast to us, so I felt confident they could restore my faith in their company overall.\n\nSome weeks later, my roommate and I decided we'd try PS310 again. I emailed Jonny that we'd like to come in and asked if he would be around. He said to come by, that he'd be there until eight, and that was it. So I emailed him back that we looked forward to it and asked if I should ask for him when we arrive. It was kind of embarrassing to ask that because I wasn't the one saying, \"Hey, if you give me something, I'll come back.\" HE OFFERED TO TAKE CARE OF US.\n\nHe NEVER responded, not even the next day or week to say \"I was so swamped. Sorry!\" OK. If you tell someone you're going to \"take care of them\" and then you ignore them, that's a worse offense than the original in my book. I wasn't expecting him to comp our entire evening, maybe just a drink or app or something, but the fact that it was HIS idea to treat us to something and then he fell off the radar is beyond offensive. Making promises you have no intention of keeping is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, especially when I wasn't expecting him to offer me anything in the first place.\n\nI now will most certainly not come back, not for any promise (lie) given in hopes of my giving the place another star on Yelp. Thankfully, I had no plans of updating my star rating until after my \"redeeming\" visit because I'm honest. Knocked you guys down yet another star today. And THAT is honest.\n\n****And if you're reading this, Jonny and/or Corporate, please don't message me about how appalled you are that I was treated so poorly. This is clearly how you guys operate. I want nothing to do with you or your false promises/mock genuineness. Good luck. You're going to need it. LA is full of delicious competition, and you are officially off my map.\nUseful 3\nFunny 1\nCool\n3/10/2014Previous review\nWent here not long ago and was treated like crap on the bartender's shoe. We were waiting for a seat at the bar. We were literally standing at the bar to wait for the bar. We ordered a couple beers to get us through. Then, a couple turns around and says, \"We're leaving. You can have our seats.\" We were so happy! We'd been waiting for 20 minutes. We looked around and saw no naysayers, so we sat down. Then the bartender comes over and says, \"They are sitting here. They were here first.\" We turn to see two \"hot chicks\" who were nowhere to be seen a moment ago, walk up from the front door and take ownership of our seats. I wanted to make a fuss, but it was so loud in there and we were completely over the wait by the time we sat down that we decided just to leave. The rest of the night was super fun, no thanks to PS310 and some desperate bartender. Place has gone down hill.\nRead more",

Portion seemed on the small side, but it ended up being really filling - and I can eat! Loved it, but service was slow (they got our order mixed up and had to wait, had they offered some bread and butter or something light while we waited it wouldnt have been a big deal, but they didn't and it was a bit annoying cause we were starving), thus the 4 stars. Food deserves 5 stars for sure.\nThe food took a bit to arrive, but worth the wait. The shrimp and grits were absolutely to die for. Comfort food galore.",

I expected someone to yell 'Mortal Kombaaat!' The music is actually so loud that you will not be able to hear someone sitting directly across from you. It's like an SNL episode.

Make a simple veggie burger or some more vegetarian options guys. That's it.\n\nFor my meal: I had the Poblano with quinoa.

They were half full but \"booked\" except for two large tables which seemed fine, but the host seemed annoyed that I was willing to sit at the tables to have a drink and some food. I tried to ask if I should order at the bar but he scurried off on his phone. Sat there for almost 10 minutes trying to make eye contact with any of the dozen or so employees walking around, but everyone was on their phone or not paying attention. Finally flagged someone down who had no clue about any of their beers, ordered some beers and still felt ignored. My beer was soapy, I mentioned it to the guy and he looked confused and annoyed. Jeez dude clear your lines, it's not rocket science. Between the shitty customer service and the baloney tap list, I just couldn't, so I paid the check and bailed.

The awesome waiter gave us some menu suggestions, that were popular, including the jidori chicken, lamb burger and steak salad.\n\nGREAT STAFF\nI ordered the Nicoise salad. The rest of the group ordered a few things, including the salmon plate, and the steak salad. The waiter came back after 5 minutes and told me that they were out of Tuna and couldn't prepare the Nicoise salad. He was nice about it, so I chose something else. 5 minutes later the restaurant manager showed up to tel me that they were out of my 2nd choice as well!\n\nAt this point, I wanted to get upset, but the manager beat me to it! He offered to cover whatever else I order that night. Dinner on him! He was super upbeat and friendly about it. So I chose another item off the menu...he looked at me in horror and replied \"Tonight is not your night. We are out of that too\".  I couldn't hide my shock! The table was shocked too...just quiet. The manager immediately started llaughing and said \"Just kidding\". LOL Boy, the entire table was in stitches.\n\nHe also bought dessert for the entire table. I ended up with the Jidori chicken, which was mind blowing! I LOVED EVERY BITE.\n\nGreat food, great vibe, and a FANTASTIC staff. Thank you!",

The \"school\" theming might be a little cheesy, but the overall vibe of the space is laid back and inviting. I enjoy their chicken wings and fries as well as their extensive beer selection. It's exactly what I would expect from a gastropub type restaurant. The staff has always been really friendly with me and able to make good beer recommendations or offer little samples (I tend to sit in the bar area, so I don't know if the waiters are as knowledgable). Everything I've tried off the menu has been tasty - it's generally focused on classic comfort foods and modern American. It can get a little loud, but that's to be expected from a restaurant with a pub/tavern vibe. Overall a good place to hang out for a casual meal or pint(s).\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nEric L.\nBusiness Manager",

Honestly, they taste pretty good, but for the price they're a HUGE ripoff. Each tot is NOT worth $1.\n\nEAT - $10 The Crispy Albacore Tacos were quite tasty on the other hand. The fried wonton skin wrapper were crisp and worked well to complement the Albacore.\n\nSKIP - $10 The Mac and Cheese app. Small portion and very little cheese for $10. I get better mac and cheese at Trader Joes. AND it's only a tenth of the price! (considering portion size)\n\nSKIP - $16 Lamb Burger. Meat itself has little to no flavor. All the flavor comes from the jam and the bread is no good either.\n\nEAT - Fries with Burgers. Fries were surprisingly tasty. One of the best things I ate.\n\nOPTION - $17 Shrimp Grits. Tried my friends order of this and the flavors were on point. Grits were tasty and well cooked. Shrimp on the other hand was over cooked and a bit rubbery.\n\nHonestly, I'd never have come here if it weren't for my friend's birthday.\nDon't come here for the food. Come here for drinks/service/ambiance.",

Magnifying lamps, globes and bookcases adorn the dining room along with multiplication tables.\n\nFood and drinks are on point here. The brown bag fries are so good and with their spicy ketchup and honey mustard it adds a gastro-pub fancy touch.\n\nI usually order the ahi tuna Ni\u00e7oise salad and its delicious every time. I would recommend dressing on the side since the dish has so much flavor.\n\nThe service here is great and everyone is super friendly. I would recommend reservations since its really busy especially around dinner time. Oh and here is a little secret, no corkage fee for your wine! I hope they never change that because my friends and I love that perk about it. If you didn't like school, don't worry, you will absolutely love Public School 310.",

That being said, this one is more of a sit down restaurant than a bar (complete opposite of PS612).  It can get really loud and really full of the Culver City usuals.  Happy Hour or \"Recess\" has a decent selection of grub.  I've had the charcuterie which is awesome, the shrimp ceviche/cocktail mix served in a mason jar which was ok, their chicken wings or whatever they're called, the not-so-ghetto dog which is good, and of course, my fave, the brown bag fries.\n\nIt's nice that this place exists.

That's where my memory of what was ordered ends. We were engrossed in conversation about life, loss and love. Tears were shed. P.S. 310 was a perfect backdrop for our intense gab fest.

My friend got the Grilled Chicken Club, and I got the Adobo Tacos and Cilantro Lime Rice.\n\nMy. Tacos. Were. So. Good.\n\n4 nice sized tacos come on the plate.. they accidentally gave me all roasted chicken and no braised short rib... but then a server came by with two short rib tacos and said we could have them as extras because they made the mistake :D Lucky us. The Cilantro Lime Rice was a bit bland, but they added Salted Pumpkin Seeds which was a nice touch and added a bit of flavor to each bite.\n\nWe split everything right down the middle and we didn't break the bank. I believe we left paying $20/ each? However you can't really put a price on satisfaction!\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool\n8/27/2014Previous review\nAnother restaurant checked off my list in downtown Culver City. I was very pleased with this one! My aunt and I walked in during my lunch break and they were able to accommodate us immediately.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly, and always prompt. We were given our drinks quickly and did not have to wait long at all for our food - considering we went during peak lunch hour. I got the Ahi Tuna Tacos and my aunt got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. Both were extremely tasty and I would definitely get these again on my next visit. The Ahi Tacos are on the appetizer menu, however, so they're kind of small.",

Also delicious on the appetizer side of things is the ahi tuna tacos - I could eat that as an entree and be perfectly satisfied! I LOVE the chopped salad with burrata - though I will say that I tend to get different amounts of burrata every time I go. The kale salad is also delicious, with just the right amount of lemon and parmesan.\n\nBut the real star is the burgers -- my coworkers love the lamb burger, though my favorite is the chicken cobb with a fried egg. It does get a bit messy though so if you get fries, don't be afraid to use them to clean up the mess!",

It was doused in lemon with good flavoring finished with parmesan cheese.\n\nI got two tequila drinks one with blackberries and the second which was too overpowering and I did not care for it but drank it nonetheless.\n\nErika was our server, probably wanted us to hit the road since we weren't ordering a lot but did a standard job as far as service goes.\n\nThis is a nice spot to meet in Culver with a good layout and ever changing menu.\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\n8/2/2013Previous review\nI really liked this place and had been wanting to go for awhile.\n\nWe were seated in a high top near the food expo window inside the restaurant.\n\nLittle things like the menus resembling a composition book from elementary school, and the alphabet written on a chalkboard make it fun and definitely a 'learning' experience in food and drinks.\n\nVincenza was our server and knew a lot about the drinks and food as well as what to suggest.\n\nI really enjoyed the 'Red Smoke' cocktail (Grapefruit, agave, jalape\u00f1o, Alipus mezcal) and the Garden Mule (Tarragon, yellow bell pepper, Karlsson's vodka).  My friend after a few tries found an enjoyable Riesling she liked.\n\nWe started with the bacon cheddar tots which were delicious though a bit crispy for my liking.\n\nI then got the Dragoons Irish Stout Short Rib (horseradish yukon mash and caramelized onion au jus).  I wanted to eat the au jus with a spoon but it absorbed into the mashed potatoes and the buttery, soft short rib.\n\nMy friend got the Lamb Bolognese (bucatini, grana padano, san marzano tomatoes,\ngrilled levain bread).  The grilled bread alone was phenomenal.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert but there are some other menu items I'd go back to try.\n\nThere is a spacious patio for nice lunches or temperate evenings.  It was $ 58.19 including tip per person.",

Today being a holiday we tried it and although busy got right in. They have a busy staff of attentive waitstaff and servers. The theme (public school meets gastro pub)is prevalent but not overdone. Food coices are simple but tasty variations on traditional fare. The beer on tap (24of them) are a shining spot for Downtown Culver City.  \nI hope they keep up the quality and the server attentiveness and I'll be back.",

What you mainly tasted was the fried wonton shell that the tuna was wrapped in. For dinner I had a kale salad with salmon--it was bland and lacking flavor, although the salmon was cooked properly (which I was pleasantly surprised about). The other people I was with had burgers and they seemed to enjoy them.\nOverall I wouldn't really think to come back here again as it wasn't very memorable, you are better off going to Father's Office down the street.",

Dine-in service can be a little chaotic, definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time. The service can be slow when it's crowded (which is a majority of the time), but the food is worth the wait.\n\nAs for take-out, it's a nightmare.  I order to take out several times a month since our office's location is nearby.  Orders will take 60 - 90 minutes to be ready, regardless of what it is, and most of the time, the orders are not accurate.  The manager was really unhelpful - I kept mentioning that I ordered when they opened but he said I still needed to order earlier.  How am I supposed to place an order when the establishment is closed? It's really frustrating and there seem to be few efforts to improve this flaw.",

There was no wait but it was PACKED in there.\n\nWe ordered the ahi tuna tacos for us to share, my friends thought it was good I was pretty meh about it.\n\nMy friends ordered beer, I got the jungle juice and it was served in a cute mason jar. Nice and strong, but half way through our drinks my friends decided that they wanted  some of their own. The waiter said we needed to finish our current drinks before ordering more (?) why? I don't get it. We're on the first round, we're moderately old (25yr olds) but don't worry one beer won't get us wasted. He hesitantly brought over the next round after making us feel like severe alcoholics.\n\nI ordered the steak ($26) and ugh it was cooked to an perfect medium rare and it was delicious. It came with a chorizo Mac and cheese which was so creamy and tasty as well.\n\nMy friend got the lamb burger. She didn't comment on it, which meant it was whatever. We were all hooked on this weird feet ketchup her burger came with. It was not very tasty but strangely addicting.\n\nMy other friend ordered the salmon salad and she barely touched it and took the whole thing home. Not sure if it was from all that alcohol we consumed....not.\n\nThen we ordered a ice cream sandwich and it HAD BACON IN IT. I was so amazed by the salty crunch in the ice cream I wept years of joy. No it didn't but it was pretty fucking good.\n\nOur bill came out to around $150 for 8 drinks, 1 appetizer, 3 entree, 1 dessert for 3 people, not bad.",

This was a truly wonderful gastropub and I can't wait to take the hubby there!\n\nThere were three things I LOVED and one thing that I hated:\n\nWe got 2 orders of the mac n' cheese because it was that AMAZING.\n\nThe baby broccoli was super tasty and so were the tater tots.\n\nThe only dish I didn't like was the chicken sausage. It was way too salty. You got salty sausage on top of salty mashed potatoes meshed with salty bacon.\n\nThe old school, school decor was on point. I loved it. And the service was excellent.\n\nThere is valet parking just outside but they do close at 10:30pm. Keep that in mind if you're thinking about watching a movie after dinner.\n\nWill be back!!! :)",

                  "review": "The beer list is great, first and foremost!  The selection is mostly local brews and mostly drafts.  They have a lot of bottles too, and a decent variety of styles that includes all of the normal styles of beer (but also looked to be slightly weighted towards stouts and IPAs).  They threw in some lesser known choices too, which I really appreciated.  Case in point, the Stone Grapefruit Slam (which was delicious) is something I didn't even know existed even though I see Stone IPAs on every craft brew list ever.\n\nWe ordered the bacon cheddar tots on the recommendation of just about everyone on Yelp. Good choice!  The insides were a mash of tots, bacon, and cheese and were pretty similar to jalapeno poppers but with bacon, and better.  I wish there were more than just 6 to a plate, but then that's a dangerous thing and I would be eating them all night.  The sriracha ketchup was good, barely spicy at all so no worries if you're sensitive to heat, but still had the peppery flavor.\n\nMy main course was the lamb bolognese.  The meat sauce was tasty with a deep roasted flavor and lots of lamb.  To be honest, I can never tell the difference between meats in bolognese, it's all ground up and soaked with sauce.  Still, it tasted great and was perfect for the bread on the side.  The noodles were bucatini, which I guess is like thick spaghetti.  They were either served al dente or that pasta is just inherently firm.  \n\nThe waitress was pretty amazing too, she had a lot to say about the beers and the food.  The rest of the staff were also amazing, they were so efficient and happy and made the place look like a well-oiled machine.  The atmosphere itself was kind of funny.  Lots of school stuff to go along with the name and the theme (although I'm not too sure about the vintage kitchen mixer, I guess that's for home ec), dark colors (always nice for a pub), and a cool little outside patio that was more open and full of lights and unobtrusive heaters.  I'd definitely like to come back and try some more beer and food, particularly the lamb burger which was sold out when I went (order early on busy nights, apparently).",

Went on a Thursday night and there was an hour wait time to be seated. The hostess offered us to hang out at the bar while we waited but  somehow we made our way to a table that is right outside the bar, still not sure if that table was a first come first serve table for the bar or we just took over it. Lol but once we sat down,and some stood around, the service was great! I tried their German Hef which was delish! We had fries and bacon cheddar tater tots, both were very yummy. Kudos for their sirracha/ketchup so yummy. Even though they were super busy the waitress was very attentive and really nice. Great ambiance to hang out and chat it up with friends.\nMenu totally goes with the theme!",

Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nThey do not tolerate any substitutions, changes, nothing. So beware--you'll get stuck with something you don't want.\n\nAnd once you have the dish you don't want, they try and get you out of there before you're done eating it. I got the salmon with succotash, the salmon was decent, the succotash was not, and scarfed it down because I was so hungry by the time we got our food. My friend was not done eating yet, she got the Farro and Brussels salad, which was definitely the thing to order, but the waitress was taking her plate away too! And I had to stop her and say: wait, I don't think she's done eating!\n\nNeedless to say I was quite angered by the staff.

The cheeses and cured meats were all delicious and the condiments that were paired with each went well together.\n\nThe Bangers & Mash was actually pretty good. I didn't really have high expectations for it, but it was pretty good and the portion was pretty big (two grilled chicken & herb sausages, bacon brussel mash, caramelized onion au jus). I really liked the bacon brussel sprout mash! Can't go wrong with bacon!\n\nThe Huntsman Burger (pure ground chuck, balsamic onions, bibb lettuce,\ntomato, huntsman cheese) was pretty good as well. It was juicy, tender and flavorful. The balsamic onions were awesome and the huntsman cheese was delish.\n\nI REALLY wanted to try to PB&J Sliders, but it wasn't on the dinner menu (RECESS menu).

Best salad! No clue why they removed it :(\n\nI'm a big fan of the speck and eggs and tater tots for appetizers. Since they removed my favorite salad I usually opt for the bangers and mash. Their mash is so good! I do wish they would expand their menu a little bit. Shrimp and grits is also great!",

Nothing builds character like books you can't write in, school evacuations for issues like mold, free violin lessons and being forced to learn the macarena in gym class.\n\nAlthough the entrees are overpriced and the menu is a little limited, I love the happy hour and the ambience here! It is definitely hip and happenin for Culver City! The service is decent when it's crazy crowded which is appreciated. If they brought their prices down a little and made their menu a little more interesting, it'd be a home run!

Monday through Friday, \"Recess\" 4-7pm features a short-list menu of items from $4-$7 and drinks from $3-$6.\nFeaturing a rotating selection of craft brew on tap, and a full bar (Cocktails, $3) there is something for everyone. Seriously, I even bring friends who don't drink to this spot.  \n\nThe Bar area (in which you MUST sit to enjoy the Recess menu) has communal tables, and can get very loud, but it's nice to meet new people.  \n\nThe \"All American Side Kicks\" cheeseburger sliders are amazing, and they don't skimp on the sauce (Habenero ketchup and mustard).\n\nThe real star though, are the Ahi Tuna Mini Tacos: served in fours on a delightful little tray, are a must. A MUST.\n\nDeviled Eggs, and Chicken Sausage, for you poor souls going low-carb.\n\nBe on the lookout though: this place reverts to pricing you would expect in DTCC after 7.",

I think everyone in our party really enjoyed what they ordered. Then came this ice cream sandwhich dessert we ordered. No lie- we purchased three of them by night's end. THREE OF THEM! There's only five of us and so I reiterate that we purchased THREE OF THEM. Shame on us- we know- but they were just too good. Like, Keebler crack good.\n\nAlso, another side are the excellent bar tenders manning the house. They were so genuine, nice, and attentive.

The thing I've noticed is the acoustic are very bad and it is hard for a group let alone two dining to really hear what the other is saying.  The bottled \"tap\" water had a smell to it that made you wonder where was the water fountain and it needs to be shut down!  We ordered salads and the mac-n-cheese and that was delicious.

I decided to just park somewhere near Culver downtown and walk around until we found a brunch.  We started toward 310 and saw their board outside advertising their weekend brunches.  It looked good so I asked if we could get a table.  They actually had room for us, which was miraculous.\n\nThe interior is decorated like a school classroom, sort of.  There are really fun things to discover all over the place.  I especially love the gym style benches that pull out from the wall, lol.  So funny.\n\nMy only complaint was the wait time and lack of table service while we waited.  Look, it was Easter so it was very busy.  But he should have checked on us at least once during the half hour we sat and waited for our orders.  The restaurant died way down while we were there so it's not like they were slammed any longer.\n\nI ordered chicken and waffles and boy, they were really incredible.  Totally beyond my expectations, which completely made up for the lack of service.  We also did the mimosa pitcher, which is a really nice amount for the price.  Ended up with a very conservative bill at the end with both of us having coffees and meals.  Really good, and I definitely recommend the weekend brunch.  Now to come out for a beer sometime!",

Fewer burger options than one would expect from a pub but each one is off the proverbial chains. Try em all for sure but I would also think of trying some other pub classic that they serve. The Bangers and mash were great.\n\nWhile I don't drink, my friends were all very pleased with there cocktails and the rotating beers on tap were of the wide variety of styles you would expect from a place like this.\n\nThe seating is great. There are long public tables that groups can sit at or people can share with other diners. If you're not into that they have smaller private tables as well. And of course, they have a bar.\n\nIt's worth mentioning the cool decor and menu style. Love the simple public school touches.",

                  "review": "What actually drew me here was the name of the place!\n\nI came here for HH, aka. Recess, and there were quite a few food options on the menu. We got the Parmesan truffle fries, as well as the Dos tacos ($5), and some well drinks which were $4. The fries were blah, and the tacos were just ok. $2.50 is kind of pricey for one taco in my opinion, which was also pretty small, even though it was HH pricing. There are slider options and pizzas as well, but we were just there for something small.\n\nI think what makes me dislike this bar is how generic it is. It looks like every other modern bar in LA, and besides the name and the \"recess\" title for HH, there really isn't anything to make it particular unique.  I feel like they could have done a lot more with the school theme... and was kind of disappointed by how conventional it was.\n\nThe place is extremely crowded and for HH you basically have to find your own spot and can be impossible in the post-work crowd. There are TV screens showing sports but they are not really in prime viewing locations, so this doesn't really make for a good sporting hangout place either.\n\nThis isn't really my kind of place, but if you want some filler food and a place with moderately priced HH drinks, it could be just good enough! It does get pretty loud though, so hopefully the person next to you is someone you want to converse with because that's about as much you will be able to hear.\n\nPS. you can park in the culver city lots, find street parking, or there is valet for $6.50!",

They are not smothered in cheese & bacon, instead it's incorporated into the tot which is a nice twist.\nThe huntsman burger - definite highlight. The patty was cooked perfectly & seasoned very well. Ground chuck is a great cut of meat to begin with and the people @ Public School paired it well with huntsman cheese, bacon, and balsamic onions. Also - I noticed they seasoned their tomatoes before putting them on the burger....a very nice and refined touch. It doesn't come with any excessive condiments on the burger - a smart move in my opinion. They believe in the flavors developed and don't need to hide anything or add anything superfluous.\nTuscan chop salad - also good. Prosciutto adds a different element to your ordinary chop so expect some new flavors.\n\nAll in all it's a good spot for lunch with a great beer selection.",

We waited way too long to be greeted, served our drinks, and our food.  We ordered one more round of drinks and it was delivered after all of our meals...after we had to remind them (this happened on both occasions). The group I was with was there for  meeting, so we continued to talk for a long time, and we didn't even dare to order a third round because who knew how long it would take.  We were there for a total of 3 hours and we only made it through two rounds of drinks.  The food took forever to come out too. And everything was delivered out of order.  There must have been no communication going on with the staff.  \n\nThe waiter barely even spoke to us, on both times going there (like as if they were too busy to breath).  I was kind of embarrassed, because I took my in laws there and the service was so bad they weren't impressed.\n\nI hope they can get their serving issues under control.

Plenty warm even for a chillier night. The inside had a great looking bar but it was pretty loud - so not the place to go for a quiet dinner.\n\nDefinitely come if you're into craft beers- they have an excellent selection with a lot of variety. If they have the XVIII Anniversary ale by Firehouse, get it! Worth every penny.\n\nFood was delicious-upscale seasonal bar food. Ahi tacos were delicious, although ahi was overpowered by whatever sauce was on top. We also has the farro salad with scallops which was light and fresh, and the poblano pepper with quinoa that had incredible flavor.\n\nFinished it off with the Nutella cookie sandwich with candied bacon, which had great potential. The cookie should have been softer and the candied bacon shaved into smaller pieces. Obviously, still an amazing dessert but not executed as well as it could have.\n\nExcellent service!

The hostess was nice, the waitress was all business and the 4 of us had a lovely lunch.\n\nI had the kale salmon cesar, while others had a burger, the handheld cobb and another salad. My salad and salmon were absolutely perfect. Seriously perfect. I'd order it again. The person who ordered the hand held cobb loved it - delicious the whole way through. An hour later, however, heavy gross city. It's a big sandwich with lots of protein, so just prepare. The other salad and burger left them both still a bit hungry and whelmed - not over, not under, just whelmed.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice place. The value of the experience seems to trump the food, but for a lot of people that seems to be the draw. It's all subjective in the end.

Great outside seating if you want to be on the street, but the inside has a more private feeling.\n\nService:  Staff is all very helpful and nice.  \n\nTips:  Short Rib with Horse Radish Mashed Potatoes!

We started with drinks at the bar and both bartenders were friendly and attentive, making the perfect manhattan.  \nWe sat outside for dinner and the patio is the perfect place to people watch!\nI ordered:\nCrispy Cauliflower--delicious! Reminiscent of chicken wings (which I don't eat), but better. The perfect amount of crusty, ever so slight crunch and spicy buffalo sauce, with some kickass blue cheese dressing on the side.\nBrussel Sprouts--yummy!! I could have ordered two plates of these and called it a day. I would call myself a brussel sprouts aficionado. I order them whenever I see them on the menu, and I have to say this place does them gooooooood!\nFries--crispy on the outside and warm on the inside. And they were fresh. You can tell they were served immediately after cooking.\n\nI see they have brunch and happy hour. I will be back!",

The food is completely not special and I swear I'm not a picky person or anything. I actually just chose to stop eating each dish that I ordered.\n2. Short rib plate is too liquidy and the meat is not flavorful.\n3. The fries are soooooo salty...they should swap some of that salt for like flavor or something.\n4. The soda I bought was by the bottle (super tiny) for 2.75 each and you best believe refills are not free.\n\nReasons why it's Ok:\n1. If you're into drinking a beer or cocktail after work, probably not a bad place for that & happy hour food\n2. Atmosphere is quite nice\n3. Staff is friendly",

The service was pleasant, we waited about 30 min to be seated on a Saturday night, not too bad!  \n\nWe ordered Fiery Calamari $10, A plate with kale, shrimp, grits, The Huntsman (medium) $14, brown bag fries $4, Scrimshaw $6, Allagash White $7.  The Calamari was like any other calamari, the grits plate was served in a cast iron skillet (not hot, just for show) - by far my favorite dish, I will be back for another order of this!  The Huntsman burger was very much like an Office Burger from Fathers Office - very good.\n\nGood food, good company, good ambiance.  Paid about $80 ish for the both of us.",

She would seat people without greeting new guests who were walking up. When I asked her \"will there be a wait?\" She said no, but walked away for several minutes without explanation. Ummmmm that's called \"a wait\".\n\nThe ambiance was different than I would have expected. Nothing really reminiscent of a school, but that wasn't a big deal.\n\nThe place was pretty noisy. I wouldn't go on a date here...you might find yourself shouting back and forth across the table.\n\nOur server took a break mid shift which is no big deal except he didn't tell us he was going on break. Luckily, the guy Ryan who filled in during the break was a sweetheart and very personable...so it didn't bother our table that our server disappeared. However, when our server came back from break he explained the switch up.\n\nI ordered a Salmon salad and the salmon was just slightly over cooked. It still tasted good....but could have been a little less dry.\n\nThe good news:\nGreat place to go with a group of friends! If you're looking for a spot that's upbeat, lively, with a good bear and ok wine list this is the spot!\n\nOur server was nice and he suggested items that we ended up liking off of the menu.\n\nDecent prices for the area and environment.",

To clearly understand my rating I have to break my review into three categories.\n\nService: 3/5\nFor those who do not know, Dine LA is a preset three (3) course menu. I looked through dozens of restaurants participating in Dine LA in July and decided to go to Public School 310 because they had, what I thought was a vegetarian option for the main course. The menu listed wheat pasta, asparagus, mushrooms, and goat cheese.\n\nWhile our waitress was taking our order the other girl in my group expressed that both of us were vegetarian. So much so that neither of us wanted the caesar salad with anchovies. When the time came to order the main course we both chose the pasta dish. Because the menu did not state that chicken was a main ingredient we did not see the need to investigate further. In addition, the waitress failed to inform us that the pasta dish contained chicken minutes after we told her we were vegetarian.\n\nWhen the main course arrived the entire table was surprised to see chicken in our \"vegetarian\" pasta. My husband stopped our waitress and stated that our dishes contained chicken. Her response, \"Yeah, the pasta comes with chicken.\" I stated that both myself and the other girl in the group clearly stated we were vegetarian and that the menu failed to state chicken was an ingredient. She stated she \"forgot\" we were vegetarian and politely took our dishes back and had them prepared without chicken.  \n\nAlthough this incident did not ruin our evening, I do believe it is deserving of a star deduction. I believe both the restaurant and the waitress were at fault. A restaurant should always list protein as an ingredient and it is the job of a waitress to pay attention to what customers request and ensure their food is prepared correctly.\n\nFood: 5/5\nMy salad was wonderful; warm watermelon and tomato were a surprisingly great combination. When the main course came correctly prepared, it was also delicious.\n\nI cannot say the same for the dessert. The brownies were hard and the peanut butter cookies looked to be a couple of days old with a blob of jelly on top.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5\nAmazing concept and great decor. It was a little loud for a sit down dinner.",

But... it didn't meet up to the expectations.\n\nThe service was really really slow, the food came out at a snail's pace and our waiter really didn't seem to care about us at all, even though we spent a crazy amount for 2 on a Monday eve, just to try everything we could.\n\nThe cheese plate was really yummy, Kale salad was great too. But everything else was okay, nothing blew me away.\n\nIts the type of place that you'll get a decent meal, nothing super memorable though.

My BFF wanted to come here to celebrate her birthday, sit on the patio and do what we do best... EAT... DRINK... AND PEOPLE WATCH!\n\nThe menu is meager, that's putting it nicely. To even consider yourself a gastropub is an abomination. Simplify your pretentious offerings and just MAYBE the chef will be able to deliver. It is public school after all not a terminal degree granting institution.\n\nWe graded our entr\u00e9es accordingly:\n1. Calamari - A\n2. Salmon with cauliflower something or another grapefruit burre blanc - F\n3. Fish and chips - C-\n4. Kids sliders w/fries - D\n5. Side of fries - B-\n\n1. We started off with the calamari. It was tasty. The batter crisp and the squid wasn't overly chewy. I believe it's advertised as \"spicy\"... That would be a \"A\" for ABSENT!\n\n2. The cauliflower cous cous was SCORCHED! And I don't mean a little char I mean BURNT, BLACKENED, INEDIBLE. My initial reaction was there may have been some mushrooms or something in there... NOPE! I almost spit it out when I tasted it. Not only had my palate been violated by the \"blackened cauliflower mystery casserole\" it was like eating water from the sea. Needless to say it went back to the kitchen.\n\nAlmost immediately the server presented me with another plate. TOTAL 180. The cauliflower was the correct shade of ecru. The server apologized and proceeded to tell me she'd stolen another patron's entr\u00e9e to replace mine. Ummmm okay. Sorry for whomever had a delay in receiving their meal. Had I known it was you I would have GLADY gifted it to you. AGAIN the side tasted like cauliflower of the sea... Like it was boiled in salted water then salted again... FAIL!\n\n3. The fish and chips were heavily battered. The breading was salty and the fish bland. The breading to fish ratio was about 3:1. That's a pretty elementary dish. I'm not sure how you managed to screw it up. The positive was definitely the fries! And the stellar condiments.\n\n4. Kids cheeseburger sliders... My son has a discerning palate for a six year old. Just because they're kids doesn't mean you can serve them CRAP and think they won't know any better. The patty was completely SCORCHED, dry and reminiscent of a hockey puck. Totally disappointed. Once again the fries saved the day!\n\n5. Since everyone's fries were the star of the show I ordered a side to coax the hunger pangs to subside because the salmon just didn't cut it. Why did I do that. Too much of a good thing is ALWAYS bad! I was brought the most GOLDEN crispy fries you've ever seen! Ohhh Emmm Geeeee!!! Did you forget they were in the oil. Although they weren't what I was expecting the Sriracha catsup and \"special\" mustard were a treat.\n\nI had a Moscow mule... Meh... The cup was the star pupil while the food excelled at being the class clown! You should be EXPELLED for the food you put out!\n\nI see why parents send their kids to PRIVATE schools in LA!\n\nPUBLIC SCHOOL 310 SUX!",

I had been in this part of Culver City before but had never eaten here or any of the other restaurants on the street. We passed by the Public School and saw what people were eating and decided that this was the place!\n\nI had a lamb burger with brie, tomato cranberry jam and arugala and it was SCRUMPTIOUS. They weren't skimpy with the meat or any part of the burger. Oh man, I was satisfied! I chose the fries instead of the quinoa salad and the fries were paired so perfectly with sriracha ketchup! *mouth watering again*\n\nI ordered their brussel sprout and butternut squash salad and that too was delicious! Very light and flavorful.\n\nThe ambience is perfect for a date or getting together with friends. Theres a huge wine and beer list (in fact it took up an entire page) so there are plenty of options here! I don't know if I'd bring children, but if you do, it's not a big deal!\n\nI would definitely come back to this place. The waiters were friendly and the environment was fun!",

Both of us being from the South and loving a solid flavorful meal and great no-nonsense  atmosphere, not so easy to find these days, we were excited. Although it was raining like a monsoon had arrived we were all smiles as was Austin our server. He was very patient with our long process of chatting before ordering and we ordered in stages. Drinks. Appetizer (Buffalo Cauliflower- even better on my second visit), then finally our meals. At first I was disappointed I couldn't get the shrimp and grits I came in for but the chicken sausage and grits was EXCEPTIONAL! That is saying something coming from a Southern foodie. She had the Humus toast and was pleased but definitely took many looks at my meal. Austin checked in with us the PERFECT amount of times and allowed us to take in the WONDERFUL atmosphere and meal. After a long brunch and plenty of time for anything to put a dampener of our EPIC Brunch at Public School 310 we got our bill, which came no where near what I was expecting to pay, we thanked Austin and even some of the entertaining customers in the bar area near us, and prepared to venture back out into the rain with TRULY SATISFIED EXPRESSIONS on our faces. If I could give a higher star count I would, and it would be doubled! One last thing about both of my experiences with this establishment. Don't be hesitant to sit in the bar area even if you think you won't be able to chat freely and be heard by your dining companion(s), there was NO PROBLEM AT ALL and even made it more FUN AND RELAXED!\n\nThank you again Austin and Public School 310. See you again soon with more new customers along for the experience.",

They reduced it down to one cheese which makes for a very sad artisanal cheese board. I would hope that they didn't change it from the full sized cutting board because of my review.\n\nThe service was great though! Since we ordered so much food, the waiter was sweet and gave us an extra plate of food. It was a brussel sprouts salad which reminded me of fall. Everything else was delicious.\nUseful 2\nFunny 1\nCool 1\n9/30/2013Previous review\nThis place is fantastic for happy hour/recess! My fianc\u00e9 and I checked it out last week. It was such a great value with the happy hour prices.\n\nWe got:\n\nDos Tacos - braised short rib & roasted chicken - $5\nThese were delicious and flavorful, but not very filling.\n\nCrispy Naked Wings - buffalo sauce, bleu cheese - $6\nThe bleu cheese was good enough to eat on its own! These were tasty and I think we got six with the order.\n\nThe Cutting Board - cured meats & artisanal cheese - $6\nAmazing! It was the bomb dot com. Four kinds of cheese, meat, almonds, olives, and garlic toast. For anyone who likes cheese, this is worth the price.",

The sausage was okay on its own but the bacon brussel mashed potatoes (which I thought were going to be stellar) included a secret ingredient that wasn't listed on the menu (we think horseradish). They were inedible.\n\nEric has been here before and he said the fries were really good. So if you're going for beers/cocktails and maybe just small plates, this may be a fun place to go.

Thanks Johnny!\n\nWhy did it take so long? They said the grits weren't coming out perfect-they were mushy, so he offered to make a different dish for me which I was totally ok with. So instead of Chicken Sausage with Cheesy Grits, I got Cap'n Crunch Crusted Stuffed French Toast. Not a bad upgrade, right? That sh*t was delicious!\n\nFor the table we got an order of bacon cheddar tater tots with Siracha ketchup. Yum!\n\nBoyfriend order The Huntsman burger. He gives it a thumbs up. Even though it was a little cold because I'm sure it was just sitting under the lamps because mine took so long. He didn't complain.\n\nNo pictures because it's all in our stomachs, and it's hard to take a picture of our insides.\n\nI'll be back for my grits.",

This location is a bit different, with more of an emphasis on a traditional seated dining experience. PS 612 involves paying at the register first, with what I think is a smaller menu. PS 310 was more of a sit-and-wait-for-the-server experience.\n\nThe place always seems really busy, and the other day was no exception. I went with the burger again, but added thick-cut bacon this time. The fries were good as usual, and the bacon really made a difference with the burger. I appreciate how they didn't overcook my burger like so many other places.\n\nService was a bit slow and they forgot about our drinks, but I won't hold a grudge since the meal was delicious. Seating was tough inside, so we sat on the outdoor patio. It was a nice day and there was a nice breeze, so it was a pleasant experience. I think we'll be back, maybe to try happy hour sometime.",

I wish I could like this place since it's so close to where I live and the ambiance is cool, but it defeats the purpose if I end up getting sick every single time. This didn't just happen to me though. I have brought both my friend and my girlfriend to this place and they both have gotten sick eating here too. Beware! Avoid the crispy chicken sandwich and the bison burger because those are both what made me sick.",

We spoke briefly and he explained that the shrimp salad is a seasonal menu item but wanted to send a gift card to me so I could go back and give one of their other menu a try.

Today with my wife we waited for 20min before we got water.  we were ready to order when waitress first walked away due to a dirty bottle of water. We were then informed something we ordered was out ad she came back without a menu about 10min layer. I ordered ginger beer but was brought ginger ale which I accepted cause it has been over 35 since we sat down...  Waitress is friendly but we must have come at shift change as she seemed to be solo, but it sucks to have to pay the same but get less service.

The chickpeas weren't great as they had zero flavor/seasoning.  C'mon chefs add some garlic, curry and smoked paprika.  I make better roasted crispy chickpeas at home.  \n\nBuffalo cauliflower - holy fried.  served with bleu cheese and hot sauce to dip in.  so yea - delicious, but not healthy.\n\nKale cesar with salmon - great cesear dressing, not too heavy and the salmon had a little crispy skin. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a semi healthy option.\n\nWe will definitely go back to try more things on the menu.",

I would give this place a 3.5, a 4 on the drink side, and a 4.5 on the service side, which is why I averaged it to a four star.\n\nI was looking forward to the adobo chicken tacos, but they were out :[. We ordered the chicken sausage with wheat mustard, hummus with pita, the truffle fries and the fish tacos. I thought the chicken sausage and hummus with pita were good. The fish tacos looked pretty damn cute because they were so tiny, but I felt that they could have used food on the inside. The fish inside reminded me of poke, which was nice. I liked the truffle fries as well. I think I will try to chicken wings the next time I go. The waitresses were attentive and made us feel good when they came by one last time to make sure to place any other orders before happy hour ended. I will be back here.

                  "review": "Eight bucks for a 12 oz beer seemed a bit stiff, but Lizard's Mouth Double IPA was an experience, I will say.  Kind of a hint of... apricot?  Which is not usual for an IPA.  Made by Figueroa Mountain and they have it on tap.  Score one.\n\nWe (buddy from Cincinnati and I) were there on a Thursday from 7 o'clock on.  It was packed, very lively, and loud.  I had Shrimp and Grits.  Yeah, you read that right.  It was delicious.  Who knew?  Apparently everybody in the South knew, according to my buddy, who says you see it in the South. It was a little spicy, which was great -- just enough, not too much.  Very tasty, and I couldn't finish it, so the portion is decent, but I am kind of light-ish eater.  My buddy had Lamb Bolognese and said it was quite tasty.  It sure looked good.  Big thick pasta noodles.  \n\nWith two beers (the other was Firestone DBA, also on tap), my tab came to about $33 before tip, which seems standard in trendy Culver City.  If you're into people watching, this is a good spot.  They also have a fairly spacious outdoor patio, so dining alfresco is definitely an option.  Right across the street, you can hear music at the Culver Hotel when you're done eating.",

I found it kind of funny when I figured out that it wasn't near a school it was actually called \"public school.\"\n\nParking was difficult but it's to be expected in the area, I used the parking structure down the street and it was free for the first hour or so which was fine for me.\n\nAfter entering and sitting at the bar, it didn't hit me that they modeled the restaurant after a school setting until I noticed all the little things they decorated with. The menu was on a school notepad, the walls were like bookshelves, the ceiling had the alphabet all around...I have to say I thought it was a very fun setting.\n\nI had one of their stronger beers, they seemed to have a great selection and all the food that I saw around me looked very good. Awesome job at creating a very unique establishment!\n\nWill be back!",

Despite having gone to UCLA, I never really explored the neighboring areas especially the happy hours!\n\nPS 310 wa cutesy little place with menus that looked like school notebooks & chalkboards and books all around. It's like a classroom/speakeasy vibe, and apparently happy hour (4-7pm) is known as \"recess\" LOL!\n\nIt was a Thurs evening and it was busy but luckily we had gotten one of the long tables that we shared with a small group who took an end. I didn't get any food, just a whiskey coke (well drink cocktails $4). The service was ok although it was a bit difficult to hail down the waitress to get our additional orders.\n\nIt's also really loud in there. I was practically yelling the entire time a sister sitting less than a foot away from me. PS 310 doesn't use \"inside voices.\"",

The beet salad was delicious. I ordered the carne asada tacos-waaaaay too raw for my liking, but when I pulled out the sure raw pieces, it was really good.  Great experience. Sitting on the patio was very nice cuz the restauarant seemed very noisy.",

                  "review": "This is my type of place! Bomb food, friendly (and easy on the eyes) staff, and relaxed environment = happy me.\n\nThe place was super packed when I went on a Friday night, meaning there was a wait and parking was next to impossible to find. Even an avid street parker like me had to give up and park in the structures, but even then, almost all of the spots were taken up. Fortunately I got lucky and found a spot on my way out of the Cardiff parking structure, but otherwise they do offer valet if you're lazy or you've given up on trying to find parking. Thankfully, parking in the structures is cheap here compared to the rest of LA - just $1/hr after your first two hours.\n\nOnwards to the rest of my experience. Although there was a wait, the hostess was friendly enough that I didn't grow impatient. It's nice because there are benches to sit on outside while you wait so you're not just awkwardly standing around. The hostess was so nice with the service that she let us have the patio seats at the front of the restaurant so that we could look at onto the streets of downtown Culver City.\n\nMy date and I shared the cutting board and each had our lamb burgers. The cutting board was good with the cheese but offered little meat. I had my lamb burger with the red quinoa salad, and they were both so so good!\n\nYou know one of those moments where you and your date suddenly go quiet but it's not awkward at all? Yeah, that's what happened to me as I was chewing on my burger and salad. The burger was packed with flavor and so juicy - a medium rare done just right. As for my salad, I usually just eat them because I force myself to, but this one was really the best quinoa salad I ever had!!\n\nThe beer there was also good, and our friendly server kept on getting us new bottled water, which was nice to rehydrate my body that can't handle alcohol.\n\nThis makes for a great second date place when you've already started to get to know one another and feel comfortable enough chowing down a juicy burger. It also makes for a nice first date place if you're a little nervous because the ambience is just so relaxed; plus, it's loud enough so that you won't have to feel obligated to tune into just the two of you the entire time if you're iffy about that date (you can hear the conversations of the other dates next to you).",

                  "review": "To the manager who helped sort out some atrocious service last night (9/1/2013): I told you that I'd be here to write a review, but thanks to you and your willingness to help out, I've bumped up the rating from a 1 to a 1.5-2. Also, I will admit that your menus and coasters are darn precious, but those are the only compliments you're getting from this unhappy customer.\n\nMy boyfriend and I arrived at Public School in a group of about 4 people and we were told while sitting on the patio by a waiter that we would have to go inside to order our drinks. There, I was introduced to the most bumbling, incompetent, inefficient, and... who am I kidding, let's just say the female bartender with dark brown, curly hair is the most useless member of food service that I've ever seen. If she's behind the bar, I'd suggest quietly (or loudly) fleeing to another location ASAP.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of trying to flag down the bartender's attention (NOTE: 10 minutes of her skipping over us in line), she finally asked what we wanted. My boyfriend ordered draft beer and I ordered a Lemon Drop. Her response to the Lemon Drop request:\n\n\"I probably can't make that. Pick something off the (extremely limited) cocktail menu.\"\n\nI thought that was odd considering the fact that she was carefully preparing a mojito, which I personally think requires more skill than alcoholic lemonade, but I'm fairly accommodating and figured it was a bar rule or something. I decided to order the Red Dragon (might be Red Smoke, I'm too underwhelmed to remember) and after another 10-15 minutes of waiting for her, she says, again while making a complicated cocktail:\n\n\"I'm not taking any cocktail requests. You can order beer or wine only... Unless you want to wait for 30-40 minutes, then I MIGHT be able to make it for you.\"\n\n... Like, what? By the way, my boyfriend still hadn't received his beer at this point, but what infuriated me was that she continued to prepare cocktails by the bushel for people who ordered AFTER us.\n\nSo yeah, I complained. And thankfully, the manager who helped out was courteous, prompt, and efficient. He handed me a Lemon Drop and my boyfriend his beer in about 3 minutes flat--at least someone there knows how to run a business! The manager proceeded to check on us again to see how we were doing and I thought that was a nice contrast to the inattentive service we'd received all night.  \n\nI came to Public School with pretty low expectations, and the truly sad thing is that they were only met through complaint. I'm definitely not coming back here again. There's too many bars in LA for this one to be so awful. Granted, if I'd heard about the C rating it received in August ahead of time (not sure if it's been resolved, but I'm grossed out regardless), I never would've gone inside, but that's a completely different story.",

Both were really tasty and very unique!\n\nWe also shared the Brown Bag fries which I have been dreaming about ever since. They come with Mustard BBBQ sauce and Sriracha Ketchup...mmmmmmm.\n\nTwo days later I went for New Year's Eve dinner and had the Caesar salad. Everyone at my table tasted it and all agreed it was the best Caesar salad they've had in a while.\n\nThe next day I went back with friends because we needed to find a place that made Bloody Marys. It was one of the few places open on New Years Day so that was great. The Bloody Marys were excellent and they have a great selection of nice beers.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention, the theme is great. Simple, but great. Globes, Multiplication tables on the walls, and napkins that look like lined paper. Cute. Love this place!",

                  "review": "3 photos\nCame on a Sunday evening about 4 o'clock. Was seated quickly.. Place has a bit of an industrial feel to it with some club type music playing overhead.. We ordered the bangers and mash and tater tots.. I had read online that the place seems to be out of tater tots more often than not but we thought we would give it a shot.. Server came back a few minutes after we order to tell us that they were out of the tots and suggested french fries. ( how are you out of a signature item right before dinner time?? ) We accepted an ordered the fries and bangers and mash.\nI should say that the waitress described the food there as \"American food with a chef driven twist.\"  I'm not sure what is American about bangers and mash fish and chips or all of the various ingredients such as irish stout, feta cheese, siriacha, and chorizo sprinkled throughout the menu..... But apparently this is what she thought American food is. It is not a cheap place to eat.. Plan on at least $20 a person if eating a meal..\nTook quite a while to get our food brought to us. French fries came first unfortunately we discovered that both of us had dirty silverware. The food runner who brought the French fries apologize and took away the dirty silverware but never replaced it. Several minutes later are bangers and mash arrived. When the waitress came to ask us how everything was we told her we did not have silverware. The sausage in the bangers and mash is a chicken and sausage that is very mild in flavor.. That is to say it doesn't have a lot of flavor on its own. They sit on top a pile of mashed potatoes that are a little thin and watery and could use some butter and salt to round out the flavor there is also a brown gravy like substance around the edge of the potatoes.. I'm not sure if this is gravy for the potatoes or a sauce for the sausage or what exactly it is for. It did not have a tremendous amount of flavor.. The decor is strange. The place is called public school the menus are made to look like composition books yet nothing else really looks like anything to remind you of any type of school.\nSlow service. Dirty silverware. Average food. Overpriced food. Reputation for being out of a signature item holds true. May return to have a beer with a friend but that would be about the only reason for a return visit........",

The food is also reasonably portioned, so I did not feel extremely bloated nor did I still feel hungry after the meal was over.\nI have eaten the adobo tacos with cilantro lime rice, and I would highly recommend these tacos. The meat in the tacos had great pickled and sweet flavors, and the rice was delicious as well. I also tried their croque madame sandwich, which was also very good. The cheese, ham, and egg did not overpower each other, which I often experience at other restaurants when I eat croque madames.\nOverall, I would highly recommend Public School 310 for a fun, unique gastro pub experience with delicious food and drink options.\nCroque Madame, Public School 310.",

Trendy gastropub with cute decor in homage of its namesake (books, globes, vintage microscopes, composition notebook menus, multiplication table over the bar, chalk board in the back). Music a wee bit loud which made conversation difficult. Waitstaff have been pleasant (although I do think they're understaffed).\n\nEach time we've ordered a slew of the $4-$7 finger foods. Parmesean truffle frites? Cheesy, garlic-y goodness. All American sidekick sliders? Delicious and moist (sorry, I love that word regardless of the controversy.) Crispy naked wings? Out of this world with just the right amount of seasoning and crisp. Things that were \"meh\" in my opinion included: white bean hummus (nothing to write home about), LA street dog (just didn't do it for me), dos tacos (not very flavorful), Wild mushroom pizza (a bit too greasy).\n\nThe common theme to both my visits was that a dish or two was inevitably forgotten by the waitstaff.\n\nBut hey, it's not pubic school unless something falls through the cracks, no?",

                  "review": "Updated review\nOk, despite being annoyed at the incorrect hours, I came back a few nights later because this place is right down the street and my boyfriend was craving the steak.\n\nI headed in while my boyfriend parked and got a glass of wine at the bar while I waited for the table. The bartender wouldn't let me get two since I only had one ID, which I totally understand. I was sat at my table before my boyfriend even got back from parking the car. Off to great start!\n\nMy boyfriend got there and sat about five minutes after I did and we waited for the waitress to come by with water and take his drink order. And waited and waited and waited. After about 15 minutes, she finally came by and he ordered a wine and the hummus appetizer. Another 10 minutes passes and she comes back out to tell him that they were out of his wine choice and to pick another. Since he wasn't expecting to need a second choice it took him a second to look over the drink menu and we could tell our waitress was about to tell us she'd come back. It was taking forever between her visits to our table so he went with a fail-safe vodka soda. My wine is low at this point so I order another glass.\n\nWe've now been sat at our table for close to 30 minutes and my boyfriend has yet to even receive a drink, so we're both pretty annoyed. We discussed leaving. The hummus arrives. It was pretty good as far as hummus goes. What felt like forever later, another waitress arrives with my boyfriends drink. Except it's a vodka tonic, not the vodka soda he ordered. Seriously? He sends it back and luckily that waitress delivered him the correct drinking within a few minutes.\n\nRight after this we finally see our normal waitress again for the first time since he ordered his drink and he asks if he wants another one. He's probably had it for three minutes at this point and she didn't seem to grasp that and walks away. My second glass of wine hasn't arrived another 10 minutes later and we've devoured the hummus since we were starving and it's been close to an hour. We have to grab our waitress as she's walking by to ask about it. She assures us it will be there soon.\n\nThe food arrives. We ordered the chicken quinoa salad, the flat iron steak, and a side of the carrot slaw. My boyfriend is a fan of this steak, it's why we came here despite this not being the first time I've been fed up with this place. My salad is missing dressing and the chicken was so chewy I had to spit a piece back out in my napkin. My wine finally arrives. The carrot slaw didn't arrive with the rest of the food and I figured it would be just another minute for the runner to come back. It never arrives. We have to grab our waitress again to ask about it. She'd forgotten, but it arrives quickly after that. We order another round of drinks at this point anticipating it to take a 10-15 minutes for them to arrive. It's maybe a bit quicker, but they arrive again with another vodka tonic. Again we send it back.\n\nWhen our waitress came by to pick up our plates, my salad had hardly been touched, and only about half of the rest of each dish had been eaten with the exception of the steak. No comment on this from the waitress, suggesting everyone else doesn't eat their food either or she just didn't care. There was no acknowledgement that everything had been incredibly slow or she was MIA most of the meal, nothing. I understand kitchens and bars get backed up, but it's up to the wait staff to keep their guests updating on the status of their items and find ways to make the visit enjoyable despite this. There was none of this. We debated requesting to speak to the manager but at this point we'd been there over two hours and we wanted to go home.\n\nOh, and our bill for this awful meal? $110. It's sad really, we loved this place for years, but I guess it's time to move on.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool",

Overpriced, loud, and poor service. Once the cool theme wears off, and the check comes, you feel like you've spent the evening at Disneyland. But with a nice selection of craft beer.\nWaiter did not know the menu, nor could give any advice on the specialty drinks or on multiple food questions. Not sure why he was working there or how he got the job. Perhaps he was still holding on to his modeling dreams. I guess the positive reviews speak to the happy hour crowd, which I am not, but when the youngest in our group (under 30) thought the music was too loud something is wrong. If you like trendy, Disneyland pub fare, then take a chance. Otherwise, don't put your palate or your patients to the test. Not worth the price.",

My vodka sour looked more like a margarita and had lime instead of cherry. Didn't complain, but I probably should have. So we ordered the chorizo mac n' cheese which was good, but we would have preferred the sampler which was much better. They were nice enough to comp us the mac n' cheese. So I got the lamb burger which was very tasty-albeit a bit dry, though that was probably my fault as I got it medium well instead of medium.\n\nOverall, the food was good but a bit pricey.

I wasn't there too long, but I loved the concept with composition books that opened up to their menu.  And lined paper beer lists.  Pretty cool.  They also have an extensive beer list, and the food looked pretty good though as I said, I didn't eat there.  The couple next to us got a slider plate that looked great.  \n\nThe waitress was very very helpful and came up to us right away.  Without us asking, she gave us the low-down on Happy Hour specials and what was on tap...  \n\nI only have ONE thing I didn't like here.  The lighting.  I like bars to be bars.  Not dive bar darkness, but dimmed lighting.  The brightness here reminded me of the kind of bar you'd find in a place that is predominantly family dining, like a Chili's or an El Torito.  This place is designed for the young, single crowd and should not remind one of a Chili's in any way.  Plus, it is so packed and loud in here, you really need to offset this with dimness of lighting to create a sense of restful peace.  Loudness and bright lights are not conducive to relaxed bar setting.\n\nJust my humble opinion.  Otherwise, I will be back again to try the food and sample more beer!!",

Not the best space and the lighting was super bright but the rest was positive. Great Happy Hour menu. These Chicken Wings were spot on delicious. First off its genius to serve wings naked or not sauced. Usually places over sauce, under sauce, or the sauce flavor is not good. They took out all those scenarios. The Wings were plump, juicy, perfectly fried, and flavorful. They came with a nice blue cheese dressing and a standard buffalo sauce. The Buffalo was weak, standard Frank's Red Hot type but the blue dressing was well done. Not too thick and not too thin. It could have used a touch more blue crumbles to be top notch, but all in all, it was tasty. Had some fried Cauliflower dish which was unique but over breaded and came with buffalo sauce and blue dressing (lazy, find another flavor profile). The street tacos were are least favorite but by no means we're they bad. Just forgetable and small. But for the price point they nailed what Happy Hour is all about. I didn't pay too much and the food and drink made me happy. That's the formula. The dinner menu looked fun and I'll be back for more. Well done Public School (not the best name).\nSee all photos from Clark B. for Public School 310",

(yes... that's a great supper -- french fries!).  and actually i *didn't* eat the fish (brought it home) because even though i could pig out i didn't.  (it's still swimsuit time afteralll!!!)  \n\nservice was efficient, if not a little cold.  i could tell our waitress was a little tired, or over the place.  i mean i totally understand that.  she did try to be pleasant but i could sense the strain beneath the surface!  still she did a good job and was provided nice service.\n\nwe all shared the lemon tarte.  again... delicious.  \n\nthe only downside is this was a group kind of reunion dinner and the place is SO loud.  i guess none of us knew that but no one could hear anyone!  but i guess that's a sign the place is happening and hopping, and with excellent food like this... i can see why.\n\ndefinitely a great find in culver city.  lively lovely loud and tasty..... ;-)",

Their truffle fries (or was it garlic fries? IDK, like I said, pretty drunk) were AWESOME. And I had a lamb burger once too that was really delicious and moist.\n\nIt gets crazy crowded here, especially during recess. Maybe this will die down over time.

Definitely a bit on the noisey side outside andin\n\nThe appetizers were pretty good - we got charcuterie and meditteranean dips.  We all ravenously devoured them.  My burger wasn't bad but I didn't love the cheese on it - it was way overpowering (can't remember what type it was).  Otherwise, every other bite was delicious.  We all had empty plates by the end of the night so I'm assume the others enjoyed their meal.\n\nOur server was very pleasant but no the most attentive, although there was nothing wrong with his service.  Just seemed busy.\n\nI really liked the beer offerings.  You can never have too many places with rotating craft beer selections.\n\nRecommended but be prepared for a crowd, noise and some high prices depending on what you order.",

Either the bar was backed up on drinks or our waiter forgot to put in our request for a couple of cocktails. But either way, the waiter comped our beverages! I was sitting right next to the kitchen and I was listening in on how they manage the window where the food is ready to be sent out. They have it allllllll together, and it makes me appreciate how much effort they put in to make sure the show runs smooth. I absolutely appreciate this place.

I've never left a single restaurant in downtown Culver City and thought that I'd gotten a good value.  With the exception of the now shuttered Santa Maria BBQ Company, none of the food has been terrible...  but it's never been good and it's certainly never been worth the price.\n\nBut we saw that Public School 310 had opened and had some happy hour specials, so we decided to walk down and give it a try.  And we're glad we did.\n\nThey have a great selection of beer and wine on happy hour and a reasonable assortment of appetizers.  The portions were small, but priced accordingly.  Two beers, two glasses of wine, and two appetizers set us back about 40...  so you can definitely get more for your money elsewhere...  but considering the area, we were pleased.\n\nDefinitely try the calamari.  My wife really enjoyed the white bean hummus, and I thought it was a bit bland.  \n\nGreat for a date night...  we'll be back, but we'll probably stick to drinks.",

Brownie points for having a kids menu!\n\nAfter looking at Yelp, we decided that the lamb burger was a must. I also saw that the bacon cheesy tots with Sriracha ketchup were really good too. My cousin's husband and I decided to split the lamb burger and the shrimp and chorizo campanelle (creamy pasta dish).\n\nThe bacon cheesy tots were really good. Crispy and had just the right amount of gooey cheesiness inside (although I would've liked more) and the spicy ketchup gave it a good kick.\n\nThe lamb burger was on spot. My thing with lamb is that it always smells and tastes a tad gamey if not done right. The burger was juicy and flavorful and the tomato \"jam\" was a great addition to the burger.\n\nMy cousin got the crunchy ahi tuna tacos. The presentation was very cute and it was a cute concept. Nothing really stood out too much about the dish though. It was a nice refreshing appetizer.\n\nThe shrimp and chorizo pasta dish was good. Not the greatest pasta I've had but pretty good for pub/bar food. I think we should've gotten the kale salad to balance out the burger. Oh well. Maybe next time.\n\nMy nephew got the pasta with tomato sauce off the kid's menu which wasn't too bad.\n\nMy only thing is that the wait staff could have been a tad more attentive/lively.",

Whether out to lunch with coworkers or clients, after-work drinks with friends, or a quick dinner before shopping, it always impresses. Obviously a step-above nearby chains, PS310 serves mostly gastropub. Ten or so burgers and sandwiches, as many salads and sides, a few starters and mains, and three-ish desserts make the menu rather intimate; you won't have to flip a dozen pages to find something you like. Thankfully, there is also a lot of variety packed in these few dishes.\n\nBurgers and sandwiches: Top-notch, but messy. Not sure this is avoidable with any decent size burger. I usually get the Huntsman, but sometimes switch it up with the lamb burger.\n\nStarters: Bacon cheddar tots. I don't care if you're vegetarian, gluten-free, or lactose intolerant. Get them. The calamari (hit or miss), mushroom lavash, and speck and eggs are also nice to try, but the tots are the clear winner.\n\nSalads: Good, nothing special. The quinoa salad is a light alternative for manly men who don't want to be seen messing with a plate of greens, but I wouldn't pass up on the other goodies just for it.\n\nMains: Fish and chips are perfectly crisp, and their remoulade is a nice deviation from the stock tartar sauces most places offer. Also, the mash with the bangers and mash is (I think) brussels sprouts, cheese, and bacon, again a nice touch to a traditional pub grub.\n\nI don't remember the desserts I've had, but yeah, they're good too.\n\nNow, why not five stars? I want them to be more adventurous: Offer some decent specials, don't confuse the dishes with a bunch of superfluous. Last time I went I asked the waitress to surprise me with the chef's favorite item. When the dish arrived, she explained it was a duck confit sandwich with fig spread and greens, an item that was not on the menu but that they were considering adding. It was absolutely wonderful!\n\nAfter trying practically everything on their relatively small menu, I'm left wanting more specials, seasonal, or whatever that will keep this place on their feet and me coming back. Really, this probably has more to say about how often I eat here instead of their menu and food. Still a solid four, though.\n\nSkip their huntsman cheese, which is a combination of cheddar and bleu. The bleu cheese drowns out every other taste it's paired with, which is always the case.",

The steak in the salad was good, but the salad itself was missing the mushrooms, which was a selling point in the first place. The Brown Bag Fries, however were outstanding. Interested to see what their dinner menu is like. The vibe was very nice, as I expected. You should be prepared for a louder vibe with the music though, which felt like a little bit much for a lunch atmosphere.\nVery cute vibe\nBrown bag fries - awesome!",

Asked the manager why and she stated they were using up meat from happy hour sliders.  The meat was cold and gray and smelled spoiled.  The cheese was dry.  Sent it back waited another 30 minutes and got a real burger as ordered,  no sorry or discount or comp,  not to mention the fact the meat was dangerous in its condition and could get someone sick,  really sick.  They should know better ND have standards to their menu,  management must not be involved in the kitchen production anymore and this should not be acceptable but I guess it is for them.  Word of advice check under the bun for old meat when you eat here or you could get really sick.",

I've been 3-4 times and thoroughly enjoyed my meal each time. The standout is definitely the lamb burger - which I have dreams about - but I feel like you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have a large selection of different craft beers but the cocktails are also delish. I've never sat inside so I don't know about the ambiance there, but the patio is lovely. Spacious, heat lamps so you can enjoy it year-round and a nice view out onto the main drag of Culver City.\n\nAlso, the waitstaff seem to all be of above average attractiveness? Well played, Public School.",

                  "review": "Pretty tasty food... fantastic service... bizarre but cute schoolyard theme. I'll take it with one raised eyebrow but hell, I'm intrigued.\n\nDuring my latest misadventure with my good friend Robert, we drove through Culver City and, on a whim, I decided to park in the nearby structure so we could scour this up-and-coming section of the city. Downtown Culver City looks really intriguing, and if Public School is any indication, I would love to come back and explore it more.\n\nI loved their four beers on tap for $4 deal - a pint of good, craft beer for four bucks is pretty much what counts as a good deal in this city. The options they had for this special all sounded great. I only ordered the bacon tater tots, which were crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside and perfect for dipping into the sriracha ketchup. It's not the biggest serving - there are about seven tots, so at $7 you're paying a buck a bite.\n\nRobert enjoyed his chicken club as he told me stories of waking up in the middle of Bogota, Colombia, next to filthy trash cans in the seediest parts of the city. How a gringo like him didn't get sliced, diced, and served up with a side of crack cocaine for the local drug lords to enjoy is beyond me, and for that, he gets five stars. The red quinoa salad I tried of his was light, healthy and utterly flavorless - perfect for vegans, I suppose. The sandwich tasted on point and is something I would consider ordering again. I wish I got to taste more food during my stay.\n\nOur waitress was absolutely awesome, accommodating (Robert didn't know what half the things on the menu were... subtract a star from him) and totally helpful. She looked like a rather large bird, now that I think about it. The menu is smallish, and Public School follows typical gastropub suit with it's fairly high prices, but I'll go ahead and say our waitress made me okay with that. Add in the convenient parking garage diagonally across the street (it was free for me... not sure what the pricing is) and Public School becomes a solid restaurant in my book. I would love to come back and splurge on the pair of interesting burgers I saw on their menu.",

Say it's not so!\n\nIt was ok though, because the other menu options made up for it.  The burger, salmon pastrami, steak...everything was great.\n\nHowever, the dinner might've been overshadowed by the happy hour that came after.  Everything on the menu is either 4, 5, or 6 dollars.  So naturally, we ordered way too much.  Hot dog, truffle fries, chicken wings, quinoa salad, calamari, and the star of the meal -- the sliders!  You must get them.\n\nGreat beer selection.\n\nOoh, and they text your phone when your table is ready, so we hopped over to the Culver Hotel for a drink while we waited for dinner on a Friday night.

Never had I come to brunch when a group of friends met up there for a post-holiday brunch.\n\nStarting brunch with a high note at 12:31pm on a pristine Sunday with a round of bloody Marys  from a flavorful homemade mix, I proceeded to eat a deviled eggs followed by the lamb burger. The gourmet burger thing is overdone but Public School 310's lamb burger over delivers on flavor and distinctiveness.\n\nI ordered the lamb burger medium, it was juicy, with the tomato cranberry jam, arugula and brie coming together for the best burger I've had in L.A. (outside of my own kitchen) ever.\n\nThis place is a gem. Super great location for late lunches and Sunday brunches. Menu that is very accommodating with minimum fuss if you are low carb (plus a nice selection of bourbon and red wine, should want to have a drink with your low carb fare and not break ketosis) - also the staff was super attentive and helpful.",

Tastes overall are unique, but everything felt a tad salty when I went last night.\n\nThings I've Tried:\n- Tots: highlight of any visit.  An very interesting blend of cheese, bacon, and potato in the best way.  The siracha ketchup is a plus that adds yet another layer of flavor.\n- Deviled Eggs:  not a fan of the onion, but other than that surprisingly creamy and tasty.\n- Kale Caesar Salad:  a pleasant surprise with a slight wasabi taste (probably caused by the kale and Caesar dressing).\n- Coconut Porter by Maui:  a nice beer blend.  The dark beer mixed with the taste of coconut leaves a chocolate-like aftertaste\n- Huntsman Burger:  FULL of flavor and fairly heavy.  The onions were a tad too caramelized.  I don't have a sweet tooth so it was a little hard to eat it all.\n\nFor the price of each individual person, this isn't my first choice when going out.  That being said, it's definitely worth a try, especially for those who enjoy unique flavors.  Visit to experience the public school theme (napkins styled like notebook paper and menus like composition books) and see for yourself if you enjoy it--I definitely know folks who LOVE this place.  :)",

I also found the salt and vinegar chips they sprinkled on top to be an extremely weird and a not pleasant combination.\nHowever, the husband enjoyed the dish.\nMy main entree was the braised short rib dish, which they call a \"shorty bowl\" on their menu.\nA possible lawsuit and just a general rule of thumb, and the safety of your customers, as well as a no no to health inspectors, is don't serve plates/ bowls with gigantic cracks in them.\nThey mashed potatoes on this dish as well as the actual short rib was fine, but they put an arugula, and green bean salad dressed in a horse radish dressing on top of a hot dish, cold salad, hot plate??? Aside from that, the salad was gross, but only because of the horse radish dressing. Just a very odd thing to make salad dressing out of.\nService was fine, and quick, they were however on the slower side, so I'd expect that.\nNot our waitress, but I did see most of the other servers leaning on tables eating food in plain view of customers, one of the servers started goofing off and he got something thrown at him and 2 of them started running around sort of chasing each other.\nI understand it's Halloween but that seemed very unprofessional.\nIt wasn't the worst experience ever, but there were some un-ignorable mishaps.\nAnother angle of the chip in the braised short rib bowl.\nThe chip in the braised short rib bowl.",

Don't miss the kale ceasar salad, a twist on the classic caesar but with mostly kale and some romaine.  Quite tasty and oh so healthy.  I also had the Chorizo and Shrimp Campanelle that was too heavy for me and I almost passed out.  I'm sticking to my five stars since it was tasty going down and the beer recommendation was excellent.  I would go back.\nKale ceasar salad, wow the healthiest ceaser I've ever had. Delicious!\nHot water w/ lemon to start",

Obviously the deviled eggs and tots are amazing.  We tried several different versions of the Moscow Mules and they were all delish.

We usually like Native Foods or Tender Greens, but thought we would try something new.\nWe were seated on the patio, and I ordered a soda. The person I was with ordered a beer since PS 310 is  known for their beer. We got the soda and beer relatively quickly, but it took awhile to order our food.\nI decide to go with the tacos, my friend went with the Brick Chicken. And then we waited. And waited. And waited.\nSeveral tables turned over. The people next to us that had been sat at the same time had finished and were wrapping up, and the table behind my friend, who had come in 15 minutes after us was served. 45 minutes went by...\nThe runner finally brought our food out. The Brick Chicken was hot, the tacos were cold. I wonder who's food we were waiting on?\n\nThe hitch is, we were never TOLD what was going on. We were never even CHECKED on, that entire time.\n\nSo, I ate the cold, little, not that great tacos.\nMy friend at the hot, little, not that great Brick Chicken.\n\nI had got off early that day from work, and by the time that we were finished with our SUBPAR food, it had basically made up for the time that I had been let out early, and I needed to go pick the kiddo up from school ASAP.\n\nIn all that time, our empty plates sat in front of us, and no one had ever checked on us to ask how our food was or checked on us at all.\n\nThe patio had filled up again, but had completely turned over from when we walked in.\n\nAt that point, I HAD to go. I needed to go get my kid from school and we were already 2 hours into a lunch that should have been less than an hour, so I left my friend to pay the tab with the understanding that we would clear it up later.\n\n7-8 minutes later, when I drove by the restaurant, I noticed my friend was no longer there so I called to find out what had happened. I thought maybe she had gone to the bathroom or something.\nShe was driving.\nShe had waited another 5 minutes, and no one had talked to her. So she got up, thanked the hostesses and left.\nWithout paying.\nWithout anyone ever.checking.on.her.",

My friend had the All American Burger made vegetarian style - lettuce, tomatoes, onion, sriracha ketchup, mustard bbq - this restaurant isn't ideal for a vegetarian, however they do serve soups and salads. We both ordered a side of their crispy fries that come a brown bag served with mustard bbq sauce, sriracha ketchup. I went a second time for their drinks :)",

Waitress showed up ...looked rushed ...keep saying are you ready to order ? 3 times !  I have to say we ordered every thing wrong from the menu. From the chicken main dish to some sausage pasta...pretty bad ! It's what I called \"complicated food \" and not healthy at all !\nAfter reading the reviews , I realized that every one go there for happy hour mostly and have the burger. Don't get fooled by the casual look of this place , you can spend very easily $80 or $90 for 2....and have a very mediocre dinner.\nIf I ever go back , I ll definitely tried to seat outside , have a beer and maybe a burger.",

I understand this is rush hour for dinner, though, so this isn't a complaint- just a head's up. With the wait, we were on a time crunch to make our 8:10 movie on time. The server did not disappoint though! He was able to get us our beers immediately, and put our order in quickly so we could still make it to our flick on time. The calamari was delicious! I do recommend checking this spot out.",

Only a few of their beers are included in happy hour, but they were all great choices. The recess menu is a wonderful find for a duo looking for a couple things to share, as most of the servings wouldn't suffice beyond a party of three.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and attentive, and also didn't mind us ordering about five different times. There was no wait, but we also arrived immediately when happy hour started. Tables seemed much fuller by the time we left. It's a little odd that the bathrooms are actually outside of the restaurant (but still inside the building, and quite clean), but that's not an issue.

                  "review": "Public School is a go but not a must-go. The concept is neat and I like the different elements of the \"public school\" theme. However, it looks like this Public School needs to learn a few lessons of its own to really stand out.\n\nThis is trendy yet casual restaurant that is reliable for good food and a fun ambiance. This is a place I would bring my friends more so than my parents. It's casual enough to stroll through before or after watching a movie or just on an off-night (think jeans and a t-shirt, even in the evenings, although you can dress up a bit if you want). The beer and drink selection is really what you should be coming for, although the food is great as well.\n\nWhy the 3 stars? Service was sub-par, and the dining experience (especially considering the higher priced menu items) was forgettable. We waited 40 minutes for our names to be called only to get seated outside at a long table that we had to share with other people...with uncomfortable seats. The lighting was really bright and unpleasant for the evening meal. Our waiter never brought us water and acted like he could care less. So in other words, this was just like any other bar where the food ordering is all business without the \"Hi, how are you this evening?\" or \"How is your food?\" I expected more and was let down with the poor customer service and not so pleasant dining experience outside. Instead of leaving thinking \"wow, this was amazing\" I literally left thinking well the food was great but otherwise its just like any other bar.",

I think the ice cream sandwich was the best thing there. The burger is definitely better than Ford's Filling Station, but not as good as Father's Office, and many others.\n\nThe cucumber mule was refreshing, and aptly served in a copper mug--big whoop. But these days, stiffer drinks are what I'm after, with more quirky flavors, that's why I switched with my friend--she ordered the Red  Smoke, and wasn't feeling it. It's certainly smoky. It's made with mezcal, but if I hadn't known better, I would have guessed La Phroiag. Yes, it tasted like a Band-aide, but in a good way.  \n\nI expected more from this place, but I'm guessing happy hour will live up to my hopes. We shall see.",

                  "review": "There are a number of factors that appealed to me about this restaurant.  It definitely had the coolness factor.  The Public School theme, with the outdoor patio, nostalgic menus, gigantic cloth napkins, globe decorations, microscopes, encyclopedia and so forth - the novelties brought back earlier memories of my youth . The servers were friendly, upbeat and conscientious.  \n\nIt was in the 50 degree range when my friend R decided to stop by one afternoon.  He being more sensitive to the cold than me asked for an inside table.  \n\nWithin a couple minutes, we were quickly seated, even though they were very busy on a weekday afternoon at 2 p.m.  My friend was very hungry, not having eaten all day.  He glanced at the menu and said \"choose something quick from where it says FOR THE TABLE\".  I chose the Mezze Plate.\n\nHe ordered a draught, which one I cannot remember, but he was pleased with it. Shortly thereafter the Mezze Plate arrived. The lavash's texture was so crisp when I broke it apart I was nearly speechless or shall I say shattered?  I live near the coast, with higher humidity, so my crackers and bread have never gotten that CRUNCHY.  Not sure if they grilled it or broiled it.  Did they use a wood fired oven?  It certainly had a distinct flavor and texture all its own - just crackly!  \n\nThe crackly lavash presented some challenges in terms of the spreads that arrived with it.  Perfectly smooth hummus, spicy baba ghanoush, tart olive tapenade, marinated feta and fried chickpeas.  But how would one get the latter on top the crackers?\n\nSpoons would have been helpful (perhaps they could offer a cocktail fork as an option) however they did not come with the standard fork and knife wrapped up in the big cloth napkin. They were indeed necessary and we had to ask.  The chickpeas rolled around and over the dish when we attempted to eat them.  I dabbed a bit of hummus, a bit of baba ghanoush, to act as glue for the chickpeas, which I planted on top, then dotted some olive tapenade.  How else could this have been eaten without the chick peas falling off the crackers?\n\nMy friend ordered the Colorado Lamb Burger. Along with it came fries and then a sigh of contentment.  \n\nMy Roasted Poblano with Quinoa was fantastic, the best I have ever had.  Not too much mozzarella, just as our waitresses, Nicole & Paige said.  The spiciness level was perfect and kicked in the farther I took bites up to the stem.  \n\nAlong with the Roasted Poblano with Quinoa, came a side of Cilantro Lime Rice.  Although the presentation was attractive, when I squeezed the grilled lime halves on the cilantro lime rice, it was a dud.  Virtually no taste.  It even was a little greasy.  Ugh, what happened here? Such a disappointment.  I have never tasted rice like this before!  Whoever cooked it I suspect did not taste it before he/she plated it.  Great green color but was it cooked in too much water?  Was it instant rice?  \n\nI thought further.  Why have 2 grain dishes on the same plate?  Quinoa and rice? How about serving the poblano pepper, which is just fine on it's own, by itself?  Hello, as a vegetarian I like having a balanced meal!! I happened to look over at other tables and their salads looked delicious.  Oh well, next time. when the weather is warmer.  \n\nBecause I did not want to end the meal on that tasteless rice, I nibbled back on the remaining items on the Mezze Plate.  My palate thrived on the various textures and flavors.  At the completion of the lunch, I came away with one last thought, timing is everything.  We got seated next to the noisy kids in school.  The people at the next table nearly shouted the entire time. Towards the end of our late lunch, a staff came to close a door near us part way.  That helped to reduce the noise level.  \n\nReally it's a three and a half stars.  They are new, so hopefully the kinks will be ironed out soon enough.",

Until Public School we have had a lot of mediocre food and service. Enter Public School- no wait and sat in a comfortable booth, Sophia, our waitress, was fantastic in every aspect. Very attentive to the tables needs, real opinions on what she was serving and her every recommendation was spot on. Prices weren't cheap but reasonable. The Tortilla soup had nice flavor and good little spicy kick and the Grilled Steak Salad was pleasantly unique and very tasty.  My only draw back is I will order both again which is always my ultimate test if I liked something or not but then I don't get to exp[lore the menu. My dining companions had the Kale Caesar Salmon and the Autumn Salmon and both really enjoyed their meals as well. See you Public School and Sophia next time we are in town!",

The food is fresh, the meat is fork tender and the best in quality.  I started with their famous melonator cocktail, a fine concoction of hand made vodka and fresh watermelon juice.  It just got better with the bison burger.  My lunch buddy who is ever so particular in a good way challenged our great server.  I cringed at her requests and though she can be difficult, this staff and restaurant rises to the occasion.  She had the wild salmon Caesar salad and a side of quinoa.  I ordered in addition to the bison burger a side of Beans and Greens which was outstanding.  Cocktails are finely crafted and very refreshing.  My hats off to the mixologist.

Both were home runs. Shrimp n grits was non-traditional and incredibly flavorful with a hint of spice. Bolognese was classic with just a little twist. Both dishes were killer. Service was a little robotic, but that isnt the worst thing on earth. Definitely impressed with the food here.",

I love me a good gastropub, so I had a delightful dinner for six here a few weeks ago.  \n\nThe place was packed, but luckily by the time I met my friends who had been seated outside for a few minutes, there was a table ready for us inside.  Now this place obviously gets props for sticking to the theme.  They really do a good job with that.  \n\nWe decided to share a bunch of food for the table, getting the speck & eggs, bacon cheddar tots, cauliflower gratin, calamari, salmon carpaccio, wild mushroom lavash, and brown bag fries.  I also had a bite of the salmon ordered by two others.  Everything was quite tasty.  I think my favorites were the tater tots and carpaccio (though that salmon was quite good too).  I think the only downside would be the price was a tad bit steep for the quantity served for my taste, but it's not unlike all the other similar restaurants in the area.\n\nThey also had a pretty extensive beer selection and I asked the waiter to help me decide between 2 options and I appreciated his choice.  \n\nA fun atmosphere, great for groups, and a pretty good bar and food menu made for an overall great experience.",

Even if you're usually not partial to lamb (like me), order it anyway because you won't be disappointed.  Their papardelle noodles are chewy and taste homemade.  Definitely not like when you boil your own dry from-the-box noodles.  This dish is worth the carbs.\n\nThe colorado lamb burger was the best burger my boyfriend said he's had.  Surrounded by a soft, brioche bun, the patty is juicy, seasoned perfectly, and has a slice of brie cheese on it (which is tasty but totally not necessary as the burger stands on its own) so if you're not a fan of brie, ask for it without.  The fries were crisp and had just the right amount of salt.\n\nThe fried calamari for an appetizer is also a good choice.  It's not chewy or excessively oily, but rather has the perfect crunch and a sprinkle of togarashi (a Japanese chili flake seasoning) to take it one step above any calamari you've had prior.  \n\nThe service once we were seated was exceptional and our waiter was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  This is a great spot for bringing a date, your friends, or both!",

It has that gastropub feel, but the food is way better than your classic pub food - more high-end pub food (artisan).  There is both indoor and outdoor seating (outdoors is on a heated patio).  I love the decor inside.  The menus are in the shape of composition books and the drink napkins have a notebooks paper design on it.  Very cute idea!  The staff are all super friendly and very helpful, answering any of our questions and helping out with drink and food orders by giving suggestions.  \n\nAnd I've already been twice for lunch!  First time I went, I had a very good experience.  They have a large craft beer selection and they bring you tasters of the beer on tap.  Also, large wine selection.  I tried the Bacon Cheddar Tots - they are to die for.  I almost ordered another!  Since I was having a light lunch, I split the lamb burger with my husband.  It was good and it came with a red quinoa salad (very tasty).\n\nThe second time I went, I arrived with a larger group.  Also a good experience overall.  We were seated right away to a table (arrived before the lunch rush).  Our group ordered the mezza plate which comes with pita bread, different dips (tapenade, hummus and baba ganoush).  Delicious!  For lunch, I ordered the roasted beet and ricotta salad. Yummy as well.  I also tried CCB (handheld cobb), basically a chicken sandwich - also very good.  One person in our group complained to the server that their french fries were overcooked.  The server took them back to the kitchen and returned shortly with several freshly correctly prepared batches on the house.  Excellent customer service!  I can't wait to return!",

My friend ordered the Juice Box (Apple, Cinnamon, Appleton Rum) and it was literally like drinking Tree Top apple juice from when we were kids.\n\nFood-wise, the bacon cheddar tots were surprisingly flavorful. They looked unappetizing (burnt and weird-shaped) but once you got over it, the flavor was great. The Roasted Beets and Ricotta salad was light, but you can tell they used canned beets (not really a deal-breaker). My friend ordered the Brick Chicken and White Bean Ragout, and it was fine. Nothing to write home about.\n\nLastly, the service was also just fine. It took at least 10 minutes for the waiter to see us for our first drink order and he didn't come as quickly to refill our drinks / ask us if we needed anything as quickly as we'd hope.\n\nOverall, a great place for Happy Hour and to take friends. Both the indoor and outdoor seating was plentiful.",

Just how I'd like my fish & chips, crispy, brown and flavorful.\n\nAside from the food, I like the atmosphere, the service was great, friendly and attentive staff but not overly attentive that you feel interrupted.  Very clever idea, \"Public School\" with the school vibes on the inside, wooden long table, kitchen area that resembles school cafeterial-ish, a cocktail napkin that looks like a note, menu that looks like the cover of the composition book and the whole interior was very well-designed to reflect the same feel.

Been here twice now and both times have been really great experiences.  \n\nI love the vibrance and buzz that Public School has brought to this space, once occupied by a very unexciting and unvibrant Fraiche. The block has now come alive -- thanks, Public School!  Yet another establishment adding to the hip trendiness of downtown Culver City.  \n\nThe Kale Caesar salad is super tasty (I got it both times) and topped with the grilled salmon, it's a surefire winner!  The Bacon Cheddar Tots are out of this world.  A must-order.  The Short Ribs are, according to my friend, are some of the best.  And as far as drinks go, I don't think I'll order anything other than the Cucumber Mule ever again!  It's perfection in a copper mug, which, I mean, how can you get more perfect!?\n\nThis is one of those restaurants that puts me in the awkward position of wanting to try something new every time I go, yet also wanting to fall back on the old favorites because they're just that satisfying!\n\nBig complaint of the space is the noise level.  It's crowded and popular which is fine, but it's frustrating when it's difficult to carry on a conversation at the dinner table on a Wednesday evening.  I wish the acoustics were a little better.  \n\nThe overall theme of the restaurant is really cute and very well executed, from the composition book menu, to the lined paper cocktail napkins, to the old-school microscopes, globes, and textbooks adorning the walls.  The only missed opportunity, in my humble opinion, are the bathrooms -- there is some great potential for the thematic design to carry through there, and it just falls flat.   Now I'm nit-picking.  \n\nOverall this place is wonderful, despite the noise level.  I'll be coming back.  \n\nI'm a product of public schooling, and now I can honestly say, I'm a fan!",

I highly recommend the meat and cheese platter and the bacon wrapped tots for sharing!\n\nFor main dishes, I've only tried the huntsman burger which is all sorts of amazing. The burger is tender and packed with flavor.\n\nSeating for a large group can be a little challenging since you can't make reservations and because you pretty much seat yourself. Just come early to get group seating and if there's no seats, just order a drink at the bar in the meantime until people leave. :)",

Their convenient system through the ipad, where you get a text message when your table is ready is far superior than holding some clunky buzzer, so kudos on that.  The bar has a wide range of beer selections both on tap and bottled, supported by a strong collection of liquors and well informed bartenders.  The crowd is friendly and the communal tables by the bar are perfect if you don't want to wait.\n\nNow onto the food...well it's opening week so of course there are going to be a few problems here and there, but the biggest disappointment was running out of their signature app, the bacon cheddar tots.  I mean, it's your best item on the menu, and you run out before 7:45? I'll forgive you since it's opening week, but please make more!\n\nI ordered the Colorado Lamb Burger, which was absolutely delicious.  Cooked medium rare, on a nice soft bun, alongside some friends with sriracha ketchup.  Sriracha makes everything better!  My friends ordered the short ribs and the fish and chips, and both were also quite delicious.  The serving of horseradish yukon mashed potatoes that accompanied the falling apart short ribs, was just the right amount of horseradish where you don't have to sniffle after a bite.  The fish and chips were crisp on the outside, slightly doughy, in a good way, on the inside, and the fish was cooked to perfection.  Service was great, the waiters are very welcoming and were on top of things when they realized something was missing (ie our drinks we ordered).\n\nI'll definitely be coming back here several times over. Welcome to the neighborhood Public School 310! I'd have done 4.5 stars but couldn't give it 5 because of running out of the tots.",

If you get up to use the bathroom, or step outside for a phone call, you have to fight your way through a sea of servers.  Let alone trying to get by the pass and server station, which are positioned opposite, so if there are more than three people in that area, it's a logjam.  And of course behind this is the strange walk to the bathroom.  It's almost like they forgot there is a hallway between the restaurant and the toilet.  A very, very, very odd and unfriendly zone.  \n\nThe menu is the usual trendy gastropub fare.  Nothing that struck me as, holy crap I must order that.  But I have heard some good things through the grapevine.  I got the lamb burger, which was just OK.  Very, very rich.  And a tad under for my taste.  Now, I prefer my lamb pink and juicy, this could of used just a minute or two more.   Again, it was fine, just not a holy crap burger.  \n\nA big gripe of mine, not only here but across this city was the wine.  I got a nice, simple Malbec.  That was warm.  How many times must I tell people, it's OK to serve red wine slightly chilled.  Hell, I'd rather have it ice cold as apposed to warm.  I mean where are they keeping this? In the kitchen?  Let alone it's a nice tannic wine, that really isn't as good warm.  OK?  Chill your red wines people.   Never, ever, ever, never serve wine warm.",

                  "review": "2 photos\nWhen this spot opened up, I was hell bent on trying it within the first 7 days of debuting.  I had been to the downtown location once for a quick drink, but as I live in the Culver City area, I'm always looking for new local spots to frequent. As it turns out, I was definitely not the only one to feel this way.  I went for happy hour on a Tuesday and the place was absolutely packed! School was in session and all the good seats were taken.  My friend and I waited patiently for a table and we also gave our name to the hostess to try and better our chances of having a place to sit.  A Solidarity Ale helped make the wait less painful. Luckily, after about 20 minutes, a spot opened up at a table on the patio.  There were literally 6 minutes before happy hour ended, and the waitress was very mindful- putting in our orders quickly to reward us for our patience. Service was pretty good considering how insanely busy the entire place was.  Things calmed down a bit after happy hour was over and more seating became available after 7. The crowd was mostly 20-30somethings and the ambiance was pretty lively as a result. The space is pretty big and I liked the layout of the restaurant. Happy hour is only in effect in the bar area and on one half of the patio, and as this place is new and trendy it'll probably be booming for a while, so just bring your patience and friendliness (there are long tables on the patio and you may have to ask someone to move their jacket or purse off of a stool politely).\n\nI had the crispy naked wings which was a party in my mouth. I also tried the crispy speck and eggs after seeing them delivered to the table next to me.  They lacked flavor, I wouldn't get those again. I also tried out the southside nachos which didn't look like I expected and weren't as plentiful as happy hour nachos at other establishments, but they were pretty good. Only some of the taps are on special during happy hour, I tried the American Amber by Vence Beach Beer Company and loved it.\n\nI read somewhere (as did my friend) that this place has a weekend brunch, but I couldn't find any info on their website, so I'll have to call and get more info about that to try on one of my next visits.\nUseful 2\nFunny 2\nCool 2\nGrill Concepts Team\nBusiness Manager",

                  "review": "The husband and I came here last minute for lunch last Saturday.  The place was busy and we were lucky to be given a booth without a wait.  First off I love what they have done with the space.  It looks 10x better than what Fraiche had done before.  As soon as we were seated we were given water and time to peruse the menu.  For drinks my husband had one of their craft beers while I chose the Moscow Mule.  I am not usually one to order Moscow Mules but this one was by far the best.  It was really refreshing and light.\n\nNow for the real nitty gritty.  We ordered the deviled eggs, the hunstman burger, and the C.C.B. subbed chicken for beef patty.  One of the managers delivered our deviled eggs and didn't think they were grandiose enough so he ordered another round for us on the house.  Now I though the first batch were pretty damn good but hell I wasn't going to complain about free food.  And guess what the first batch were just as good as the second.  My husband loved his C.C.B. and left nothing behind.  The huntman burger reminded me of a F.O.'s burger minus the different buns.  It was perfect in its simplicity.  \n\nI am lovin' the new kid on the block and should make a great place for adult play time.",

The hummus was creamy, the feta was flavorful, the tapenade had just the right amount of oil and the bread was fresh, warm and fluffy. We scraped the board.\n\nI split the CCB and the Moroccan Spiced Chicken Club -- I loved them both, but if I had to pick, I would go with the Moroccan next time. Well spiced, tons of flavor and the bacon in both sandwiches was thick, crispy and not drenched in grease. Fries were pretty good too.\n\nAnd, the service was on point! I'm definitely looking forward to going back and trying more of the goodness this place dishes up.\n\nCheers!",

It was a little difficult to find a seat, but some nice people were willing to share their table on the outside (heated) patio.\n\nOut server was a snarky, funny guy and service was prompt. Drinks were served quickly.  The food came out quickly (but the sliders came a bit later than expected.  we had to follow up on them, but they came soon after we said something to our waiter).  When we asked for water, they gave us two glasses and our own bottle of tap water =)\n\nDrinks.  They offer $4 handles during recess, which basically is a $4 pint of beer.  They have 4 different varieties, but it changes nightly.  So we ordered the 24 hangar (an orange wheat beer) and the fiance got the moose drool (name sounds gross, but he liked it).  Pretty good deal!\n\nFood.  We ordered the naked wings, pb&j sliders, and the truffle fries.  Let's discuss in order of yumminess (from least yummy to most yummy)  \n1. The truffle fries (yelp.com/biz_photos/publ\u2026).  These were nice and crispy.  I had no idea that fries could be TOO crispy for me, but these were! They had some good flavor, but the truffle fries at Rush street still win.  I'm very happy we ordered the naked wings so that we could dip the fries into the naked wing sauce!\n2. The naked wings were delish (yelp.com/biz_photos/publ\u2026)!  It comes with 3 dipping sauces - hot sauce, blue cheese, and mustard BBQ.  All the sauces were yummy and I was confused about mustard BBQ at first.  Like, what IS that? However, that's exactly how it tastes.  It's not quite honey mustard.  It's not really BBQ sauce.  It's mustard BBQ!\n3. The pb&j sliders (yelp.com/biz_photos/publ\u2026).  These win by a landslide!! The meat was cooked to a perfect medium.  The bun was yummy and held together.  The blackberry habanero jam was nice and sweet and had a little spicy kick at the end.  And smoked bacon is always awesome.\n\nThe only hiccup we had was that they charged us twice for the sliders (maybe because we had to follow up with them?).  Anyway, our server promptly took them off the bill.  \n\nOverall, we LOVE the new addition to downtown Culver! We shall be back for dinner.  I want to try these tots everyone has been raving about!!",

                  "review": "For those who are looking for an American style restaurant which has a through selection of beers on tap, this is the place to go.\n\nThe vibe is upbeat and lively; the general seating area is a great place to just grab a beer and watch TV. I would not say it's the most romantic joint on the block, but definitely a place to hang out and have a good time.\n\nThe food is definitely \"New\" American, with a variety of selections that is basically a fusion of all types of food - ranging from short ribs, sashimi appetizers, to the typical burger. Like most of the other comments, the bacon tater tots are very good; the hint of cheese and bacon flavor and bits inside the tater tot with the hint of saltiness will definitely satisfy anyone's savory cravings.\n\nIf you're a burger person, the traditional beef patty is pretty solid; the medium rare cut is juicy and flavorful (especially when paired with a beer). The onions add a sweet hint of flavor to the after taste along with the tomato that relieved the usually heavy meaty flavor of the meats. The cheese is what really sold the burger to me: the mixture of the two cheeses (I think gruyere and cheddar?) gives it a different flavor compared to most premium burgers (such as father's office burger or stouts).\n\nHowever this place is not the right place for wine. The waiters don't know their selection of wine as well, so don't expect a through explanation of where the wine is from or what to expect from each glass.  \n\nThe albacore appetizers where good but did not stand out to me. This dish was nice and light with fresh albacore, however the flavor was masked by the sauce they put on the dish. The crunchy tacos made me slightly confused with the dish, are we eating sashimi or are we eating tacos? This dish definitely was good with different flavors and all, but not something I would order again.\n\nOverall, this restaurant is pretty solid for a hangout spot more so than a first date location. Their vast beer selection and savory dishes is pretty awesome. Expect to spend a decent amount if you're buying drinks and food! #sodelicious",

From the minute we put our names in for a table (the bar was too packed for us to enjoy happy hour) to the moment we walked out, everything was great.\n\nOur waiter (Christian) and all the other waiters (including Chris, who did very amusing things with his suspenders) were super nice and helpful, joked around with us, and came around to ask how our good was. We spoke with one of the managers (Matt) to tell him how great our experience was.\n\nIf you're a beer person (like my friend) you'll love the selection. If you're like me and you prefer a cocktail, their cocktail menu is a little limited BUT they have a full bar, so you can still order whatever you want. I ordered the Violet Berries. It was quite tasty.\n\nThe food was fantastic. My friend and I each started with an order of bacon cheddar tots....amazing! Crispy and oh so delicious. My friend had the lamb burger - she loved it.I had the short rib with horseradish mashed potatoes. Also excellent. The couple at the table next to us ordered the fish and chips and (I believe) a burger with a side of the quinoa salad. They loved their food as well.\n\nLoved this place. Can't wait to go back. Only bummer was that we couldn't take part in happy hour because it was so crowded. So I spent twice as money as I intended. Oh and if you want to try the tots, go early! Our waiter told us they've run out every night so far.",

It's supposed to have braised short rib, arugula, smashed potatoes, grilled tomatoes, snap peas and a 6 second egg. The egg was good, short rib was delicious, the two bites that I got. It was ALL fris\u00e9e. And a half baked potato at the bottom. All I could taste was fried potato parts. So not satisfying! And it was $16 - I should have taken it back as I saw other customers who ordered the same dish do.",

But expensive for a burger so -1.  Last time I didn't order the burger and got a stout reduced short ribs dish that was OK. 3.

We were told there was a 45 minute wait, ok, so she takes my name and number and says she'll find us when there is a table for us. We hangout for about 15 minutes outside before we go inside to get a beer while we are waiting. An hour later, nothing happens. No one comes to find us, no one calls or texts my phone. We decided to swipe some chairs at a bar table where some people had just left. It took 10 minutes for someone to take our order, after she had acknowledged that we were there. I ordered a simple soup and my bf order some tacos. The soup was so bland and extremely disappointing, especially after having waited as long as we did. The tacos looked pretty, but bf said they were merely ok. After it took all of five minutes for us to decide that we were completely over this place, we waited another 10-15 minutes to locate our waitress. I asked for our ticket and bounced out of there without so much as a thank you or a goodbye. We will not be returning.\n\nNote that my phone still never rang or buzzed once letting us know that our table was ready.",

We decided to figure out what all the fuss was about.\n\nEven though the place was packed, they sat us at a two top immediately which was appreciated. Our server, Sara, was just WONDERFUL. My boyfriend and I  both worked in restaurants many years, and both agreed that Sara was the ideal server, and much better at it then either of us ever were. She was so friendly, helpful, excited about the food and beyond that, a cool human being. Thank you, Sara!\n\nWe shared a kale salad which had great flavor - anchovies and egg in it! Big portion too. She gave us extra anchovies to make up for the fact that they were out of tater tots which we originally ordered. A nice gesture.\n\nWe also shared the fish and chips which was super delicious. The fish was so fresh and the batter was light and crispy. Fries were great too - also crispy which I dig.\n\nThe most important part of this meal was THE BROWNIE. I repeat - GET THE BROWNIE. It was literally THE BEST BROWNIE we have ever eaten. It's so moist, and rich! It has a little layer of chocolate frosting on top and comes with vanilla ice cream. There's also a dusting of cayenne pepper on it which adds a little kick. My boyfriend said \"I don't understand...I'm kind of angry about how good this brownie is\", and we shook our head in disbelief until the last bite.\n\nOh and I had the Red Smoke cocktail which was really good! Grapefruit, Mezcal, Jalepeno. First sour, then smokey and then you get a punch of spice at the end. Definitely worth trying.\n\nNice atmosphere, prices are reasonable, portions are big, staff is awesome, food came out super fast, best brownie ever. Definitely worth the trek to Culver City.\n\nClass dismissed!",

I ordered my personal favorites Golden Road hefeweizen and Kwak, the latter of which is served in the traditional round-bottom glass and wood stand.\n\nFood is delicious. Do get there early to enjoy the bacon cheddar tots that sell out every night. Order one for everyone in your party, you don't want to share these. Maybe order two. You won't be disappointed. Unless you don't like bacon, then there's no talking sense to you.\n\nBut really, the best part of this restaurant (aside from the excellent food and drinks) is the customer service.  I've never been to a newly opened restaurant that ran without hiccups: waiters not quite knowing the menu, having to wait little longer to receive food and/or drinks, etc. You walk in expecting a little bit of confusion when a place has only been open a week and a half. But there was none of that to be had here.\n\nThe staff is incredibly friendly and has a hilarious sense of humor. They tease one another (one person came by and apologized for our waiter's--Christian, who is incredibly attractive--funny looking face, and asked us to be nice to him in spite of it), but it's clear this is done out of camaraderie and not malice. Great wait staff, great hosting staff. Exceptionally professional, it's like the restaurant has been operating for decades. The public school theme is cute and carried out nicely without being overwhelmingly trite. It's a grown up place with wooden bleachers in the wall!\n\nI can't wait to come back and have more bacon cheddar tots.",

The noise level was a little high and it made it difficult to have a conversation over dinner.\n\nWe shared the shrimp and red quinoa salad (cucumber, feta, tomatoes, arugula, olives, and pine nuts) and Colorado lamb burger (tomato cranberry jam, arugula, and brie).  Both were good, but not as amazing as some other reviewers had described.  \n\nThis place seems better for a group setting than date night.",

                  "review": "I'm loving Downtown Culver City more and more with each restaurant that I try. I've wanted to try Public School for a few months now as it's close to my office and my coworkers have been raving about it since some of them go there for lunch. First of all, if you get nothing else, just get the bacon and cheddar tots... because they're absolutely scrumptious. Everything is pretty much moderately priced and they give you pretty good sized portions so you really are getting your money's worth. Also, they have a pretty good balance on the menu so even the pickiest eaters can find something that they'll like.\n\nThumbs up!",

Make reservations, or wait around a 1/2 hour - have a drink across the street at the Culver Hotel!\nThe Shrub is a great drink, the mushroom lavash app is great, as is the quinoa-stuffed poblano pepper. They have homemade bacon tater tots! And a key lime pie that comes layered in a mason jar. Wow.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n10/14/2013Previous review\nYes Culver City!\nPublic School is just one of many great newer restaurants helping to make downtown Culver so great at night.\nIf you don't make a reservation, you can wait and they'll text you when a table opens. (Probably be awhile!) Have a drink at The Culver or Fords.\nFood is consistently good- poblano chili quinoa good, as is mushroom lavash bread. Homemade bacon tater tots!!!\nDrink menu changes seasonally, I think? So don't get too attached. Mixology style cocktails. Beer selection amazing.\nLemon meringue pie comes in a mason jar and is delish.",

We were on the outside patio on one of the coldest nights in years and with the overhead heaters on, were fine.\n\nSpecifically the Lamb Burger got rave reviews at our table. Also, the Cheddar Bacon Tator Tats with Sriracha ketchup wear nothing short of amazing and completely addictive.  I ordered the Jabori (?) Brick Chicken.  It was ok, probably not a repeat order.  \n\nGreat beer selection (I had several Moose Drools), excellent drink menu.  The Shrubbery & The Cucumber Mule were both enjoyed at our table.  Price is kinda what you'd expect for a gastropub in LA.\n\nWe also got one of each of the deserts, the PB&J cookies, Lemon Meringue and Chocolate brownie.  Although they were fine, I'd skip the cookies and pick one of the others.  Especially the meringue.  It's served in a mason jar and is as delicious as it is kitschy.\n\nThe only complaint is that the water glasses are tiny.  They do leave you with big pitchers of water on the table though.",

It was a Wednesday night around 7pm. We were seated right away...Score!! Right?! NOT!! We literally sat at our table for 15 minutes waiting for our server..and no one came! After deciding that if no one showed up in the next 5 minutes we would walk out, I flagged the waitress serving the table next to us down to see if she was our server. Surprise surprise, she wasn't. I think she could sense my irritation so she took our drink order and said she would get our waitress.\n\n10 minutes later our scotch arrived..however, our server did not. Extremely irritated at this point, the same girl who took our drink order came back and took our food order. Hubby ordered the New York Strip with Chimichurri while I ordered the Roasted Poblano with Quinoa. Literally took FOREVER to get our food. Service was so slow that the table next to us asked for their check before their dinner even arrived. Oh and our actual waitress did eventually come by and show her face. She brought our food out eventually, but never checked on us again. After we were finished, our empty plates sat in front of us for 15 minutes until we were so fed up we asked a bus boy to clear our plates and fetch our waitress for our check. Not sure what the deal was that night. The food was quite good with lots of flavor however I would never return as it wasn't THAT good to put up with horrible service and overall frustrating experience. If I wasn't in the industry I would not have left a tip.",

I want to tentatively believe that the answer is yes. But I don't want to get my hopes up just to go back and find out that it's fallen to the ugo-rushstreet-fordsfillingstation-citytavern curse.\n\nWhen the wife and I went last week, it was great. The staff was extremely friendly, the food was great, and the prices were as-expected (not crazy but not cheap).\n\nWe had the tater tots (life-changing), brocollini (ok, but nothing special), cauliflower (cheesy goodness), and margarita lavash (eat it fast or it gets soggy!).  Everything came out quickly and was extremely high quality.\n\nWe sat at one of the communal tables, which was very convenient, but watch out because they roll! Meaning if you happen to slightly push it, the whole thing slides away from you. Just a heads up. It's also reallllly loud, so bring your outside voices.\n\nAnyway, I'm crossing my fingers that this place stays top-notch.",

Some observations:\n\nNice in that new homey zeitgeisty sort of way of the places we've suddenly decided we want to live in / have been led to believe we do.  Homey in sort of exposed brick, concrete, reclaimed wood warehouse lighting above tables as if we all live in turn of the century warehouses.  And chalkboards.  \n\nIt may be the only bar anywhere, ever to list whole number prices on their chalk written menu and then to add tax.  Expect not to pay $7 for a beer, but $7.63.  \n\nI thought it was happy hour.  There was also some other chalk filled sign that appeared to indicate this.  Perhaps the bar staff did not walk past the same sign.\n\nAttractive bar maid, nee tax collector.\n\nThis place has Fr\u00fcli.  It's like a beer smoothie.  Try it if only to see if you can taste alcohol.  I believe it'll run you $9.81.",

                  "review": "Went there for casual business lunch (no booze) today. We had planned to meet at 12:30pm, but since it was a warm day, my friend got there at 12:00pm to make sure we could sit outside on the patio.\n\nWe were seated at a cocktail table on stainless or aluminum barstools with no back or sides. It looks cool, but you may find yourself sliding around depending on what your pants or skirt are made of.\n\nThe lunch crowd was average, looked like everyone else had a bout a 5 minute wait in line or less. The patio was comfortably full. The service was very good, everyone was friendly from the hostess to the servers.\n\nThe menus are cute and look like little notebooks (\"Menu Composition\").\n\nThe Bacon Cheddar Tots ($7) were overrated and just a few seconds short of being burnt to a crisp. They were so overcooked they resembled little burnt haystacks. My friend had been there before and dug right into them so I guess that's what they are supposed to look like, but they tasted like burnt McDonald's hash browns with bacon. They were served with \"Sriracha ketchup\" - Sriracha is that bottled hot sauce in a squeeze bottle you might see at every Asian or Hawaiian BBQ restaurant in the world, you know what I'm talking about, that bottle right by the cash register. You know how it tastes too, right?This ketchup didn't have any noticeable kick or spice at all. Disappointing.\n\nWe also shared the Crispy Spec and Eggs ($6). \"Speck\" is smoked ham, so if you knew that you might think ham and eggs as in breakfast. Nope, it is actually deviled eggs with a slice of fried prosciutto for garnish. I thought \"OMG $6 for 2 deviled eggs?!?!\" I mean, I didn't see them listed as organic or cage-free or happy chicken eggs or anything to justify the cost of $1.50 per half egg. I'm sorry, I admit I am used to buying eggs for $1.99 for a dozen, so this was a reminder that I clip coupons moment. The fried prosciutto tasted just like the bacon from the tots. The eggs were just OK. Not bad, but definitely not inspiring.\n\nMy Kale Caesar Salad ($8) with Roasted Chicken ($4) added was really good. I had never eaten raw kale before so didn't know what to expect other than it would be healthy. It came pre-tossed in dressing and was well-flavored. The chicken was tossed into the salad, they didn't cheat and use boiled chicken - I hate that boiled flavor and texture - and the amount of chicken was just right. The kale was chopped up in nice bite-sized shreds and it must have been young kale or baby kale - I am used to kale as in \"cooked greens with a ham hock\" - so I was pleasantly surprised. The croutons were crunchy toasted hand torn pieces of bread. Not sure if I tasted olive oil and/or garlic, but they were good as well. The salad was huge and I took a good portion of it home.\n\nMy companion had the Schoolyard Dog ($9) a hot dog on a \"lobster roll\". To some people a lobster roll is the actual sandwich, including the lobster filling. Here the term refers to the type/style of bread. The hot dog was served with grilled onions and peppers and there was bacon all over it (I think my friend liked bacon LOL). It was a big hot dog, akin to a polish dog I guess. Fries were served on the side in a little cardboard box (like at school). It was a business lunch so I did not try to taste his food, LOL, but he enjoyed it.\n\nService overall was good, water is served in glass bottles and the water glasses are not much bigger than shot glasses. In fact, I think they were double shot glasses. Our iced teas were refilled constantly, and I mean *constantly* as in while I had one in my hand, the server would drop off another one for me. The wait between appetizers and entree was perfectly timed.\n\nThe only little glitch came when my companion asked for coffee (per the server's suggestion). The server actually came back with the bill before she brought the coffee, and then she had to take the bill back and add the coffee to it and swap the receipts and you know, now that I think of it, she might have actually charged us for the meal and then had to charge the coffee on another bill. I may have been wrong, but there was some back and forth and I think she should have just comped the coffee and spared everyone the trouble. The coffee service was interesting, a clear glass mug with a metal handle and cream served in a tiny handmade looking ceramic pitcher.\n\nAs I was leaving I asked what time Happy Hour was and the very cute and helpful host couldn't find a card or menu and offered to get one for me. After about 5 minutes he came back empty handed and apologized but told me the hours and some of the pricing.\n\nThe Ladies room was clean, extra supplies are stored in there in case you need to look for TP. Stalls had turn-around room and hooks.\n\nAll in all convenient if you are in the area but not a \"must do\". Would like to try at Happy Hour though.",

Tiramisu French toast was absolutely amazing.\n\n3. Music was a bit loud for a brunch..\n\n4. Chicken and grits loaded with flavor.\n\n5. Peanut butter and jelly desert thing, did not really get the idea behind this but wow delicious.\n\nI hear they are opening one near me in Sherman oaks. Cannot wait !!\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n5/27/2014Previous review\nSo my wife and I came here late on Sunday night and we were surprised to be greeted with such open arms and smiles. We then asked to be seated outside.. Which could of been a disaster due to having some drunk patron throw up within 3 feet of us. Then the whole service team was quick to respond by cleaning the mess and having a manager come by and pay us a visit. Let me tell you that Christina (I think that's the managers name) really made our night by shinning humor on the subject and making us feel at home by allowing us to move.\n\nI would like to say that the food that we were able to eat before that event was fantastic, bacon cheddar tater tots, bangers and mash hmm flash back.\n\nWe will be back not only to try the food we were unable to eat but for the service and respect for customer satisfaction.\n\nThank you again (Christina)? And the whole public school team.",

Unique and tasty.\n\nCan I just be honest? Your name is Public School but all the food descriptions are flowery fancy hard-to-discern stuff. Put it in PLAIN english.\n\nThey get points for sticking to the theme. The \"ruled paper\" napkins, clipboard for the check, but the rest of the place looks somewhat fancy. It seems like theres a bit of conflict choosing a theme here.\n\nEither way, it certainly wasn't bad.",

It starts with the menu that is the form of a Composition Book. The shelves are loaded with items like microscopes, globes, and encyclopedias. There is outdoor dining with large canopies, but if you eat out there you'll miss the interesting artifacts.\nThe star on the menu is the long list of of brews. Many draughts, in bottles, or to share. They also have a nice list of wines (what I drink).\nLots of burgers to choose from as  well as other good menu items. We were there for brunch and could have two Mimosas, Bloody Mary's for the price of one. I had a dish with cheese grits that was very good but the french toast sounded like it would be my choice the next time we visit.",

Unfortunately PS310 was having an unusually bad day. Ran out of mimosas and some of the brunch entree's and our waitress was pretty unwelcoming. HOWEVER, the bus guy and I assume manager, Sean, went above and beyond to make up for it. Their customer service was awesome and they handled the situation like true professionals. My table was introduced to new dishes at no charge and were treated more like friends than guest. These gentlemen were terrific, worked great under pressure, and are a true asset to the company.

We were surprised at how much we would end up liking this place! We saw a sign that said \"24 draft brews\" and we were hooked. We read from the chalkboard wall menu for the beers and picked our firsts. After that, we realized the actual menu had some beers not on the chalkboard menu, and we ordered a DuPont beer per the recommendation of a co-worker of mine. I don't see those around very often, so I was glad to see this place had some, expressing their variety. The service was a little lax, but that's only because the poor bartender had to make a drink called the Violet Berry(?) for a table of ~15 and then more people kept ordering it after they saw it, so we saw him make an easy 25-30 of those in the time it took us to drink 3 glasses of beer.\n\nThe decor here is great because they keep it Public School themed, meaning everything - from the composition notebook styled menus to the chalkboard menus on the walls or math cards hanging around the ceiling - screams nostalgic throwback to being in elementary school. Even one of the TV's was playing a channel called \"cookie jar tv\" or something like that, and it was just showing old school cartoons we used to watch growing up. Place definitely gets a thumbs up in my book.",

So they get a thumbs up.\n\nRoom had a buzz to it upon entering and you feel like you are in a vibrant happening place. Another plus.\n\nFood sadly was terrible. Ordered a dark beer with some Fish & Chips. Soggy & Spongy might have been a better name. In fact I am not sure I could recreate whatever they were battered in unless you gave me some play dough and a ziplock bag.\n\nI will go back, to try something else, to see if they get their training wheels off. They deserve that consideration if only for a decent atmosphere and beer list.\n\nMaybe a good after work meeting place for apps and a pint.\n\nDon't believe the hype but do go and try it for yourself. I for one would like them to succeed and get better.",

I ordered a wine carafe and an artisan cheese board to share, expecting a wide variety of \"artisan cheeses\" the menu had described. The cheese board took about half an hour to arrive, and I probably could have eaten it by myself in about three bites. With only one type of cheese. Bummer.\n\nThe service was friendly, but disorganized. They brought me spring rolls I didn't order three different times and charged me for them when they finally just left them on the table. Pure confusion!!!\n\nIf not for the full bar, I would probably rather eat at a regular cafeteria.",

It's a little bizarre that the host/hostesses greet you from what seems like a mini-platform outside. It felt a little odd. Was seated quickly and sampled the American Burger, Kale salad, and the bacon cheddar tater tots. Big beer selection. Bloody mary was tasty and refreshing on a fall afternoon. Food was pleasantly good, but nothing out of the ordinary per se. However, the bacon tater tots are well worth trying and it seems like everyone writes about these so i couldn't resist adding my bit about them too.\n\nGreat place to grab a drink and bit before or after catching a movie and it's great addition to the downtown culver city area.",

However, the service can be a bit slow, and the food, although there are some high points (bacon cheddar tots), doesn't quite live up to the intended gastropub level, trending more towards your typical bar food. Without enough of a crowd to classify as a popular bar scene, Public School is stuck in the middle as a restaurant that isn't on the same level as some nearby options like Akasha or Ford's Filling Station.\n\nThat being said, the patio is nice, the beer selection is very solid, and the atmosphere is fun and welcoming. Plus, the composition book menus are a nice touch. It's a fun spot to check out with a group that is looking to grab a drink and a snack, but that's about it.",

                  "review": "Very rude hostesses. Reading through the other reviews it seems they favor young trendy looking people. But they were rude to me and I'm a young graphic designer, so I was always dress to impress. My thinking is that they are just straight up racist.\n\nI really wanted to give Public School a great rating, because the food is spot on, the beer selection is excellent, and the atmosphere is lively and fun. Because of this, I give them 3 stars, one for each reason. However, I've had two experiences there that have left me with bitter tastes, and I don't know if I'd ever like to go again because of these.\n\nThe first time I went, I went with my boyfriend. We are both in our early twenties, he's white and I'm White/Japanese. We were greeted, sat down, and our waiter came promptly. He explained how everything worked, recommended some dishes, and was genuinely very pleasant. What sticks out is the delicious tuna tar tar, the crispy shell was delightfully crunchy without being greasy. Overall it was an excellent experience.\n\nFast forward to the second time I was there. I went with an Asian friend of mine for dinner. Since it was a Friday night, it was understandably packed. The hostess was a little stand offish when we approached her which to me was understandable since she was so busy. She told us the wait would be around 25 min. Reasonable for a Friday night. We decided that we would rather sit outside though because it was so nice out, and when we told her, she definitely became more agitated and told us that outside would take another 20 min. Alright, we could do 45 min.\n\nSo we are standing around chatting, time goes on and on and soon it's been around 45 min. We notice that people who arrived after us are being seated outside. We inquire about when we will be seated.\n\nThe hostess is very stand offish again and points to a table and says that once it's bussed we will be seated. We are thrilled that soon we will be chowing down on delicious public school food!\n\nSo we stand around again waiting for a bit so that the table can be taken care of. But when we look over, the hostess is sitting two MILFy blonde women at our table.\n\nWe immediately go over and ask for an explanation. A different hostess is very sympathetic to us and says it's a mistake and apologizes. She says the next table will definitely be ours.\n\nOk...so by now it's been an hour and fifteen minutes. I go over to ask for a table inside because it's getting ridiculous. Suddenly I see an empty, clean, ready table tucked away in the back of the outside area. The rude hostess is there again. I point to the table and ask if it's our table.\n\nAnd this is what really sent me off the edge. She squirmed around and started trying to say something about I don't even know what, it was apparent she really didn't want us to have it. Then the nice hostess came back and said of course it was our table, sorry for the inconvenience, etc etc. What. The. HELL. So basically, if I hadn't seen that table, it would have been given to someone else!\n\nBy this point I was fuming, and didn't really want to eat there anymore, but our waiter was super sympathetic, gave us some free drinks and an appetizer so this in my mind redeemed public school. I went there again after with my boyfriend and had a pleasant experience, so I was once again sold on Public School.\n\nUNTIL...\n\nA few days ago, I went with another one of my Asian friends to public school for lunch. It wasn't crowded, there were just some old white people sitting outside and plenty of tables outside are available. Went to the hostess, she flat out ignored us and tried to act as if she was super busy (how can you be that busy when there's barely anyone in the restaurant?). Another hostess came up, we pointed to the three open tables outside, and she acted like she didn't want us to have them, being really reluctant and round a bout with her words. In my mind, I'm thinking what the hell is wrong with these people??). She sits us down reluctantly. Our waiter was fine though, very nice guy. Food was great. He recommended an excellent IPA for me as well. I went to the bathroom a few times because of the beer, each time I saw one of the hostesses checking herself out in the mirror. Is that why the hostesses are so busy? Yeesh.\n\nWhile the food here is excellent, I don't think I will be going anymore. The hostess is the first person you encounter at a restaurant, so you want to be welcomed rather than judged or straight up ignored. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth for the rest of the meal. I'm someone who values treating waiters and hosts with respect but if they can't give me the same respect that's...disgusting.\n\nIf you are put off by the ideas of rude hostesses, a place that might be comparable to public school is Beer Belly in terms of food and beer. However, their customer service is AWESOME. Super friendly and nice.\n\nTL:DR Rude hostesses make this place not worth it. If you are Asian, prepare to be treated poorly.",

We thoroughly enjoyed the wild mushroom lavash pizza, truffle fries, and deviled eggs all at half off. Plus, we shared a half liter of a very nice petite sirah for only $10! There is quite a large beer selection if that is your thing too. We also ordered the brownie (not on the HH menu). It was gooey chocolatey deliciousness with a hint of chile. Yum! The decor is bright and school themed and the serving staff is extremely friendly and attentive - a definite step up from Fraiche which used to inhabit the space. The crowd seemed young (but not too young if you know what I mean) and fun. I'll definitely be back.",

Too easy to make for for 3 halves of an egg.\n\nI'd come back!\n\nThere are heated lamps outside. Buy a drink inside and then go outside and start keeping an eye out for a seat",

There was a generous amount of seating (which is always critical for group happy hour get-togethers). The waitress kept the orders straight. The beer selection was good (but not that cheap).\n\nThe food though, was pretty good. $6 sliders (get the PB&J). $5 calamari that came in a heaping pile of fried, chewy goodness. Everything was so good that we had a few rounds of all of the above.\n\nThere were a few let-downs though. The half-liter of wine was cheap, but of low quality (as evidenced by the splitting headache I got after we got home). The waitress , while competent and quick at bussing empty dishes and plates, seemed to actively avoid asking us if we wanted another drink, etc.\n\nToo bad. We'll be back, Public School. I hope you're ready for us!",

I also really enjoy the text message table system. Just give them your number and the place texts you when your table is ready.\n\nCONS: While the drink menu is great, the food is just average. It's nothing to write home about but also nothing to whine about. I've been here a few times and had the Fish & Chips, The Lamb Burger and The Salmon-Pastrami Reuben. For the record, there's no Pastrami in the Reuben. In my opinion, similar menus at the nearby City Tavern, Father's Office and even Rush Street all have better food. And if you come on a weekend, be prepared to wait.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Fun theme, great drink menu, just average food.\n\nRETURN FACTOR: Will probably be back eventually.",

                  "review": "Another delicious beer spot walking distance from my apt? Sign me up. @PSonTap\n\nFirst off, this place was JAM PACKED (hence the caps) for a Wednesday night. Granted, it's only been open 9 days so it's still in its honeymoon phase of its relationship with the locals, but wow. I arrived at 8ish with a 45 minute wait...did I mention it was a WEDNESDAY? Oh well, it was a great excuse to grab a beer or two from the bar.\n\nOne thing which I really like is that they take down your phone # and text when your table is ready (huge brownie points) so that you can wander around downtown Culver vs. waiting in the cramped bar space if you're so inclined.\n\nUpon walking in, nostalgia got the better of my ADD inner child due to their elementary school theme (A+ on your branding, kids). They had everything from composition notebook menus to microscopes from science class on the wall and lined paper napkins for your drink. If only they had a pet like an Iguana or Hamster; you know, pets we always had in the classroom as kids. Also, hopscotch on the floors would have been a fun touch along with painting the tables blue or green like the lunch tables we ate at and...well, you get the idea. Bonus points: their happy hour is called Recess (with some ultra tasty sounding bites and drinks) and they even have a drink called the Juicebox.\n\nWhere was I? Oh yea, the food and drink. With 24 beers on tap + signature mixed drinks and wine, it's hard not to find something you like (especially since the bartenders were so attentive). Being a big beer fan, I started the night with a pint of Point the Way IPA from Golden Road Brewing Co, which was surprisingly delicious considering I've yet to find a decent IPA that doesn't come from San Diego (Stone and Green Flash come to mind) or nor cal (Pliny the Elder). Curious how often they rotate their taps, but I will say the prices were more affordable than Father's Office.\n\nIt was odd that after we were paged, it took 10 minutes to get us seated considering we left our prime spot at the bar, but I can overlook that for the great table service. I started with the Brussel Sprout and Farro salad, which was really light and fresh, but could definitely use some seasoning or citrus. I was thinking maybe a balsamic vinaigrette or some lemon juice.\n\nEntree wise, I got the Jidori Chicken, which was mouth-watering to say the least considering it sat in a bed of tomato broth of sorts. My girlfriend got the short rib, which was a bit lacking in flavor, but the quality of the meat itself was awesome (melted in your mouth); thankfully it came with a mountain of mashed potatoes that blew our minds and palettes.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, but then again, I consider beer my dessert (followed my Point the Way IPA with some Hop Head Red from Green Flash, should have gone with the West Coast IPA, one of my favs).\n\nWe'll definitely be back for dinner and hopefully for Recess, but I'd say this is the type of place you can't go with a party any larger than 4 (6 at the max) or else you can expect to wait a really long time.\n\nP.S. being a beer restaurant, I'd strongly encourage fellow beer drinkers to download the \"UNTAPPD\" app on your smartphones to keep track of your fav beers (likes and dislikes) and let others know where the good beer's at.",

On happy hour/bar menu? 4.\n\nLet's go with dinner menu for now:\nMeh.\nI had the fish and chips. Way too much batter, and a little soggy. Nothing special here. Best fish and chips I've ever had in So Cal, would have to be at Mohawk Bend. If you've had that, you know where I'm coming from. My friends have had the burgers, and they're your standard, good fair.\n\nNow onto happy hour.\nDefinitely the stand out here...I'll try to run down the list of what we've had:\n\nSliders - great little sliders. Definitely not the dry disks you usually get at other joints...these were on little buttered buns, great little ground beef patties that are cooked to about medium rare. Juicy and definitely tasty.\n\nChicken wings - our favorites...light and crispy, just like the kind of batter you find on wings, Chinese style...I can't explain it, but if you know what I'm talking about as Chinese style...then this'll seem really familiar.\n\nLavash pizza - nothing to write home about. Kinda dry, not that great.\n\nFrites - not bad...typical fries dusted with parmesan and truffle oil.\n\nTacos - pretty damn good...short rib is succulent and tasty.\n\nStreet dog - hefty ass dog. Great bun. Almost like King's Hawaiian bread.\n\nNachos - they use freshly fried chips (I think...not the shitty corn tortilla kind) and they're pretty damn good.\n\nEverything is between $4-6, and with a bunch of drinks, my wife and I can usually escape totally filled, for about $50-60.\n\nNOW PAY ATTENTION TO THIS PART.\nWhat I love the most?\nTheir well whiskey is BUFFALO TRACE.\nWhat's Buffalo Trace? Well, the best damn bourbon you can get here in 'Murica of course!\n\nBut seriously, during hh, well drinks are $4. YES. That means, you can get a nice Trace on the rocks/neat/with water/whatever, for FOUR DOLLARS.\n\nBUFFALO TRACE FOR FOUR DOLLARS.",

We ordered an appetizer of  cheddar-bacon tater tots with siracha ketchup, there is no downside to this, they were perfect. Our entrees were great, I had a quinoa stuffed Poblano pepper with a cilantro lime rice, again no downside. Everything was fresh and hot, the waiter was on it.

Their fries come with ketchup and the most delicious mustard I've ever had. Today I had the jidori fried chicken & cornbread waffles. They too were fantastic!! Looking for a tasty dessert?

We were seated on on the patio which was nice, but the plastic roll down window kept flapping in the wind and smacking me in the side.  They couldn't even fix it becuas the flap could not physically be hooked to the rail.\n\nWe ordered our food and waited...and waited...finally after 30 minutes or so it arrived, cold.\n\nThe food overall had good flavors.  I had the lamb burger with fries.  The fries were simlar to In-N-Out fries. They probably would have been really good if they were hot, or even warm.  The lamb burger was juicy even though I ordered it medium well.  However, it was a crime against burgers and food to bite into it only to be surprised with a mouthful of unincorporated seasoning and spices.  After picking apart the burger I found it was full of pockets of spices.  Clearly they hadn't taken the time to ensure the spices were incorporated appropriately into the ground lamb and this was a huge bummer.  The spices provided for good flavor, but eating a bite of pretty much just spice is not so good.\n\nI would definitely give them another try once they have more time to work these operational and quality control issues out.",

The food and atmosphere get 4 stars but service drops it to a generous 3. Ordered a salmon well done, server repeats well done, salmon is served seared. Sent back, takes over 20 minutes to recook. Definitely could have used additional drinks meanwhile but server was nowhere to be found to asks us if there was anything else we wanted. Actually, with scorching hot temps on the patio, we would expect water to be plentiful but that also took a few inquiries before we got any. This may have been it for me and this place.

It tasted like bacon was added to the recipe to hide that fact that the chef didn't really know how to make real shrimp and grits.  Also, the caesar salad came with anchovies and crumbled egg on it, neither of which were on the menu description.  Sorry, not coming back.",

Here the napkins are lined paper, menus are composition books, and happy hour is \"recess.\"\n\nThe playful theme is reflected in the beers and food. The bacon tater tots really steal the show (unfortunately, NOT on the happy hour menu). After a few visits, all the food has its own unique twist but nothing that screams \"YOU MUST TRY THIS\". The PBJ slider with jalepeno blueberry jam, peanut butter, and bacon definitely takes by surprise (in a good way) - could use more jam though.\n\nAbout 20 or so beers on tap, and several more bottled. As a fan of Belgian beers, there's definitely 4-5 choice ones to try, and there's a rotating menu. Priced at 7-9 bucks per beer, you're paying a premium, but it's worth it. There's even a few huge bottles for you to share with buddies, pals, or compadres.\n\nThe wait is definitely a beast at peak hours. But hey, jump across the street to culver hotel for some live music while you wait it out.\n\nThe fun factor/ambiance is definitely 4 stars, but the moderately high prices, long wait at times, good but not great food, drops it to 3 for me.",

We tried a bunch of the happy hour appetizers, and all were very good. Calamari was crispy and of a decent portion, considering it was a happy hour item. The ahi tuna was very good as well, as was the hummus. Cool atmosphere in a great location of Culver City.

Getting past that the food was average. I had the steak with the chorizo mac and cheese and my friend had the lamb burger and fries. Steak was nothing to brag about but the mac and cheese was quite flavorful. Visually appetizing and it also had some potato chips sprinkled in. The Lamb burger was soft, well cooked and light. Menu seemed a tad pricey. Overall it's worth checking out if your near the area but not a place to go out of your way to check out.",

The mule came in a copper mug, which was odd but still delicious. We decided to split food and share.\n\nWe started with the cheddar bacon tots. OH. MY. GOD. Best tots ever. The siracha ketchup was unreal. They were gone within minutes.\n\nThe speck and eggs were so good. The crispy prosciutto was phenom. Those were also gone within minutes.\n\nOur main dish, we decided to get the dragoons irish stout short rib plate. It had this yukon mash underneath it that was killer. It was a sloppy mess while eating - all off the meat and mash got smooshed but it was SO GOOD that it didn't matter.\n\nAll the while, our waiter was really cool - very talkative, wanted to know what we thought about each dish and was really fun.\n\nDifferent from Public School 612, which is downtown LA and still really great but more of a bar hang out than a restaurant.",

I get why people like the Kale Caesar. The surprise of seeing some chovies on top of my salad tipped the scale from a 3.5 to a 4. I liked the fries because they were well done (aka, see through because they were so greasy and crunchy). I loved my bacon cheddar tots - they might have stolen the show. The mezza plate wasn't something to write home about.\n\nBut what I do know is that: 1. I will be back. Their craft beer selection is poppin... Dogfish Head?! Sold. 2. I will never eat ketchup the same way ever again. Their Sriracha ketchup changed my life.",

I have to remember, I'm in cc and they don't stay open late on the weekday. So, finally tonight, made dinner reservations for my girlfriends to celebrate a birthday. The food was pretty good, but our service was even better. Venice, yes, that's her name, but you pronounce it Veenece! Rocked it! She was on her game, with all the appetizers that we ordered, they came out at a Good flow and she would continue to stop by to check on us. Me, being the piggy, still was hungry, continued to order. So, the tater tots were good, the cheese and meat platter was the best and the fish and Chips were crisp and the fries were pretty good. I still ended up ordering the humus platter to, since my tummy was still 1/2 empty. The Cosmo was very delicious, better than the one I had an hour prior of being there at a different bar. The finale was the lemon meringue pie that was amazing!\nI would definitely come back again during the HH prices, so glad I finally tried this place.",

I got another burger, the Huntsman. It was good. But it was also cheddar, grilled onions, and bacon. Not much to mess up there. All in all, I'll probably be back to try it.

And they have about every beer your could think of.\n\nThe only issue I have with this place is they have no light beers. I really like Pilsner and I don't really stray too far from an Ale. But, to have only one light beer, Scrimshaw, is kind of ridiculous, when that is the whole idea behind the place.\n\nAlso, the menu hasn't really changed much since they opened.  There aren't enough choices to want to keep coming back a few times a month. I live in Culver City and love all the little places around downtown and Public School is still on my top 10, I just wish they would expand the menu/beer menu a little.\n\nDefinitely a must go!",

And any place that has Allagash White on tap automatically gets brownie points.\n\nOrdered the tots and the cauliflower gratin as the starter, and while the tots were tasty, not sure if the greasiness of it is worth another order. Sadly, the cauliflower gratin was NOT the consistency of mac and cheese noted by the server and watery, melted cheese didn't help cover up the taste of cooked cauliflower. The deviled egg did look promising on the menu, so looking forward to another trip to check out that dish.\n\nFor the entree, I ordered the kale cesar with pan seared salmon, which I spied couple of chic ladies eating at the bar. I'm pretty sure it wasn't as healthy as I pretended it was. My friend ordered the lamb burger and quinoa salad and that was finished without any complaints.\n\nFor dessert, the peanut butter and jelly cookie made my night.\n\nWill be back, sans order of the cauliflower gratin.",

During the previous visit I paid about $11 for one cocktail, which was mainly ice. This time was a similar experience.\n\nThe All American sounded good from the description - a typical burger with all the trimmings and some french fries. Typical sums up the burger, but isn't a compliment. First, the medium burger came well done. Not a hint of pink to even suggest the cook paid attention to cooking time. If the burger had come medium it wouldn't have been saved. For an $11 burger ($13 with bacon), they must be making all their margins on seasonings that they don't use in the meat. Why is this thing so bland? How about some seasoning salt, or just a little salt a pepper?\n\nA burger without character is a complete waste of time. There's nothing original about the burger, nothing that will let you know you can only get this burger at Public School. No carmelized onions, basic lettuce, a dash of barely there mustard, and not a single swipe of mayo on the bun. There was no love for this burger before it hit the grill, or after.\n\nThe fries were french fries. Crispy, with some kosher salt thrown on last minute.\n\nWhat does everyone see in this place? Is it the outdoor seating or just the selection of overpriced alcohol? No need to come back - once was enough for me.",

However the last few times I've visited have been a bit of a miss. I wouldn't recommend coming here for a nice intimate conversation with anyone, as it is very loud (especially inside). The food and service was a little subpar compared to other experiences. Overall it's a cool and hip place to enjoy some craft beers and decent food. You should definitely check it out at least once!",

Our waiter was super friendly and was very knowledgeable on everything that Public School had to offer. My friends and I all ordered drinks first which all had fun names that were 'school terms' like the Juice Box. The food is large enough to split, which is exactly what we did. We ordered a few appetizers and the chicken, which was perfect to feed 4. Sharing a few dishes here will allow you to try a little of everything and still leave feeling full.",

Most of the happy hour tables are shared (long) so just an fyi in case you're not into that.  I've also had lunch and dinner here and food is good but seems expensive for what it is sometimes.

                  "review": "So a friend took me down here because it is one of his favorite places to drink and eat. I was hungry myself, didn't really care for drinking beer. The environment I have to admit is a bit fancy, which is all right. We sat outside so there was a lot of chatter going on. Ok, onto the food and the beer:\n\nI'll start with the beer. I didn't know what to choose, but in the end after trying three samples (2 citrus, 1 peach type of beers), I ended up getting a beer called 'Hanger 24', it tasted like a really soft blue moon, not too bad.\n\nThere were three of us, so we all pitched in on an appetizer, the platter included: cheese, nuts, meat, honey, and sauteed onions.  After the platter was finished, I really felt this place was just not for me. I didn't see how much that platter cost, but I bet it was expensive. It's just that \"taste\" and ESPECIALLY presentation that automatically lets you know it's pricey. Hard to explain.\n\nOkay finally onto the disappointment. I chose the 'huntsman' burger. The first thing I noticed was the top bun, it was greasy as heck. The burger included lettuce, tomatoes, big patty, cheese, and I think mustard. That's it! A burger isn't a burger without ONIONS. In addition, a brown bag (with all kinds of grease spots all around the bag...talk about presentation!) with really skinny greasy french fries, similar to Houston's fries only a lot worse. So I take a bite on the burger, the patty LITERALLY exploded with grease, it dripped all the way to my chin. Not only did I feel embarrassed, but disgusted. I then knew I was doomed for heart burn. The buns smashed easily, there wasn't enough lettuce or tomatoes, the cheese was cheddar over american (american has a better taste...this is preference).\n\nTwo other friends both got the salmon pastrami sandwich and one beer each. I had the burger and one beer. Plus the appetizer platter....the bill came out to be $88. We divided it to 3, so I ended up paying $33 (including tip) for a lousy 'Mondo' burger (lol, good burger reference. It DID look like the burger in the movie), with god-awful fries, and a really decent beer.\n\nWho in their right mind would pay more than $20+ for burger and crappy fries? I know what you're going to say \"You!\", well here's the thing. Everything in that menu is either strange and/or expensive. The burger I think was one of the cheapest choices. Don't come here to dine, you'll regret it unless you're biased due to the location/environment or a fan. I didn't even care to talk about the elementary school theme they have going on. After 12 years of grade school, who cares really.\n\nI will never come back here again to dine, maybe to drink.",

Chris, who was our waiter and also the resident beer somalier, said it would be a good pairing and it was! The sculpin is now one of my favorite beers. Hoppy intensity and grapefruit flavors.\n\nMy girlfriend had the huntsman which had  cheese and cheddar. The huntsman was also executed well.\n\nOverall a great addition to downtown Culver City.

Four just for having PBJ Bacon Sliders, but .5 taken away for only having them during happy hour.\n\nArrived at 5:30 with my friend and scored the last two seats at the bar. I ordered a Juice Box and he ordered a Red Smoke. Mine was delicious, but sweet enough that one was my limit, and his was... smokey. If you like that, good on you. I switched to Happy Hour $4 well vodka, and we ordered from the Recess Menu.\n\nWhite Bean Hummus: very tasty, good texture. Small portion, but I was tipsy and it all worked out fine.\n\nDos Tacos: looked good, he ate them both, I have no confirmation that they were delicious other than that they were gone.\n\nStreet Dog: Tasty, as any bacon hot dog would be, but the bacon was a little over done and I resent paying more than $3 for a hotdog.\n\nPB&J Bacon Sliders: what the what. These were damn good, though a tiny bit more PB&J would have sent me off in to bliss. I would go back just for these.\n\nWhen we got there the service was great; by the time we left they seemed over-worked and a little frustrated. I feel that pain!

From the notebook menus, clipboard checks, to the walls of microscopes and books, there's a nice continuity. I went on their second day open and it was a great experience. I've also been a few times since for lunch and happy hour, and had a little bit less of a great experience.\n\nPros: Friendly service, GREAT bar food, good beer selection, great cocktails\n\nCons: Gets very busy/crowded, it is so loud my brain hurts (seriously, it's to the point that it feels like they want to eliminate conversation and push you out the door as quickly as possible)\n\nI love coming here before the crowd, but that is the only time I'll go. Otherwise, it's too loud to enjoy myself and I don't want to try to eat while being assaulted by purses as people try to squeeze past me to get to the bar (every time I've been in the bar area, I've been hit by bags, elbowed by passerby, or otherwise jostled; not my idea of a relaxing evening out).\n\nTry the cheesy bacon tots, they're worth every calorie!",

When I asked how long the wait would be, I was told 30 minutes. We were starving so we went on to City Tavern but that's another story...\n\nThis past Sunday, the misses and I made an attempt to hit our favorite spot in Venice for some people watching and early dinner but we couldn't get past Lincoln boulevard. Apparently everyone else on the west-side had the same idea, too. Traffic was at a snail's pace! We cut our losses and went in the opposite direction into downtown Culver City. This time Public School 310 was not crowded and we chose to sit outside and enjoy the warmer weather.\n\nOur waiter was very polite and helpful in helping me select a beer. (He brought samples; Dear Public School, you get bonus points - most places don't offer samples or have polite/helpful waiters! Sincerely, Me) I chose the \"Smog City, \" my wife doesn't drink. In this instance, I like \"Smog City.\" For food, my better half had the Roasted Beets & Ricotta Salad while I tried their Fish & Chips. The salad had a lot of flavor and wasn't drowned or saturated with fancy dressing. The breading on the Fish & Chips looked a little over cooked but the actual fish (inside) was moist, hot, and tender. The added bonus (we both agree) was the remoulade sauce! Forget tartar sauce, this is sauce sends your taste buds to flavor country and you're enjoying the view! The \"chips\", however, were like slightly over cooked In N' Out fries (sorry, not a fan of In N' Out but will eat there before Mc Donald's or Burger King any day) but I still enjoyed my meal and my time here.\n\nOnce we received our check and decided to leave, I couldn't help but notice another table's order of Lamb(?) and mashed potatoes. Even after being stuffed I wanted this dish. It looked so amazing that I felt like I cheated myself out of it by choosing the Fish & Chips (that I really did enjoy).\n\nIt's kinda' funny.\n\nI thought I'd be more excited about their beer selection than their food...\n\nWe're absolutely going back and I will have the this dish!\nFish and Chips",

We shared apps so we had the naked chicken wings, the buffalo cauliflower (my new favorites), calamari, the deviled eggs and the truffle fries. Everything was good.  Although one of the girls had the nicoise salad and sent it back.  We had a wide variety of apps to sample.  I would definitely go back for happy hour.

I had the Bison burger, and after much anticipation the actual burger was very anti climactic. While the whiskey sauce was good, the meat itself was very tough and hard to eat. It's a shame because the restaurant had a pretty cool vibe, and our server was great. Just the food...it kinda sucked. And when you spend $50+ on a meal for two you have a right to expect better.",

The salmon was perfect with succotash (which sounds terrible, but tasted good), and the flat iron steak was perfect! I ordered medium and it came more of a medium-rare, but I think it was better that way. My husband and son had the nutella sandwich for desert, and it was so rich that they couldn't finish...good for two to share. Interesting menu, very loud atmosphere (don't go here to whisper sweet nothings), but lots of good choices, and excellent service!",

I'll have to come back to to give it another shot, but in my initial visit I was certainly disappointed by the Salmon-Pastrami Ruben (sic).  In no way, shape or form was this a reuben.  Sure it was rye bread, but it was not grilled! (Maybe slightly toasted.)  There was no pastrami. There was no sauerkraut.  In fact it was COLD super salty salmon.  The closest thing it resembled was lox on bread that was folded into a sandwich with a bit of shredded lettuce thrown in. Bleh.\n\nAs far as the tots, you only get five.  The calamari was good.  Fries were ok. Sriracha ketchup was nice. Table setting was nice.",

If only I had checked the menu....\nAs soon as we got there it was clear they didn't want to be serving brunch but felt pressured to do it anyway. The brunch menu has your standard cocktails and only 5 food items. This place doesn't do substitutions, which is fine, but the server Danica, didn't understand the difference between a substitution and a side order. She told us everything was pre-portioned out so they couldn't do sides of bacon? At brunch? She got our coffee order wrong, wouldn't bring out extra cream then proceeded to ignore us the rest of the time we were there.\nAll in all, great place but horrible for brunch. Downtown culver city has so many options that are more accommodating. Go for lunch, dinner or happy hour here instead.",

We had to leave so I ended up with no dinner.  I blame management on how poorly this place is ran. I blame the owner on a crappy low brow menu.  But as we walked the main street of Culver City I noticed that 90% of the restaurants are mediocre.  It seems that this area of Culver has turned into one big food court mall offering--low quality food and service, but high prices.",

However, the applewood bacon was not on the burger so we notified the waitress and just told her it wasn't a problem but to please not add it to the bill. to drink i got the Tito's Sunset which was well presented and very refreshing. for dinner i ordered the bangers & mash which was probably the only thing on the menu that sounded appealing to me (other than the huntsman which my husband shared with me). the food was good but i would of liked to order off the lunch menu for dinner as they have more options.\ni would recommend this place for those who love to try different types of beer who just wants to drink with their friends. but would probably eat elsewhere.\n\nEverybody has different experiences when it comes to the same service.\nGo and experience it for yourself.",

We promptly ordered the red wine option off the happy hour (3 glasses for $10). The waiter comes back by and we order about 6 happy hour dishes (still no wine). He comes by again to tell us the bar poured the white rather than red wine and it would be another min (what?!? How does it take 30min to pour wine)...after about 40 min of having food and no wine he comes back to tell us they are out of the happy hour red and there are no substitutions he can make (530pm...and you have 1.5 more hrs of hh ... that's going to make for a rough night of orders). He said he they would take care of some of the food for the wait (he didn't).\n\nThey also tried to serve us a second round of just about every menu item we ordered.

We were with our kids and our server made them feel comfortable, moving closer to them to take their order, getting them refills and generally not ignoring them- big plus. The food was good- our kids had the Huntsman and the sliders and compared them to Umami- Umami won I think just because they're used to umami burgers. But the Bison burger was very good. And I regret for not trying their popular lamb burger- may have to come back to try that. Their calamari and the kale salad were awesome though. Food came out in a decent amount of time even though they were packed and probably getting slammed.  I liked how one of the managers came over and delivered the calamari explaining that the rest of the dishes would be out soon. I'd recommend this place.",

It's happened more than once here, and it breaks by heart every time. This place is tasty and great, but they just never have anything they list on the menu. Why is that?  I'm just beginning to accept that my luck isn't the best and I wasn't meant to have what I'm looking for and move on to what they do have available.\n\nAnother pain I have with this place is their wait staff takes forever to get to your table. I have been tempted to leave before, but I always seem to be with someone who helps pass the time with talking about what's going on in the world today so it's somewhat tolerable...somewhat.\n\nTheir Recess AKA Happy Hour is always busy, but you can manage to find a seat. It's Monday-Friday 4-7, and they have some awesome options that tend to always be available; I would recommend the tacos since the flavors are awesome! If you're someone to try anything once, test out the peanut butter and jalapeno burger with bacon. It sounds horrible, but trust me, you'll order it again.",

I was directed by the host that happy hour seating was at the bar area and the communal tables near there. So my boyfriend and I sat down and waited to be greeted and given menus. We waited approximately 6 minutes no one came with menu's so I got up went to the bar asked the girl behind the bar for menu's. We then started looking through the menu and decided what we wanted to order in the next two minutes. So we waited for the server to come to our table to take our order for another 10 minutes which I then decided this is ridiculous and I am going to ask for service. The host told me the bartender is our server so I then walked over to the bar and asked the bartender if she could come take our order and she said yes just give me a minute. We waited and waited as we watched her take the orders of all the people at the bar. Once she was finished we figured she would come over to our table but no she didn't she then began to make all the drinks for the other servers and for the people at the bar. When I asked for service she was rude and short with me sadly I didn't get her name she was a blonde caucasian women. I was very disappointed that she neglected to provide good customer service or just any period. She certainly lost our business we decided to leave and give the resturant \"Rush\" across the street our business as they provided us with better service and we're very efficient.",

Our waiter was incredibly nice and everyone in my group forgave the service hiccups because of this (and the fact that he was incredibly good looking).\n\nOur first beers were flat and they lost one of our food orders, but we still had a positive experience overall.  The sliders were excellent, the pizza good and the wings outstanding. It's not the greatest deal for happy hour due to the size of the portions, but it is definitely a fun place to go to school! I will be glad when they solve the overcrowding in the classroom problem (which will inevitably happen once the newness wears off). They have a nice patio that is great on a warm evening. I would recommend going on a weeknight so as to avoid the craziness.",

Ask if the customers prefer flat or sparkling water.\n\n2. Ask if the customers prefer bar seating/patio during happy hour or else regular sit down menu.\n\n3. The wooden floor inside the restaurant is actually quite slippery. Too polished? Don't wait for someone to slip and fall!\n\nFood wise.\n\nI like the fact they serve full calamari tentacles. Not a lot of places do this except for Cantonese joints in East LA. However...the breading was thick and flaky. I know it can be done just a notch better. And I know this restaurant can do it better.\n\nFish and chips. Sizable portion. Fresh fish. Decent serving of fries. Can definitely taste the beer battered crust. However, yet again the crust was too thick. Felt like I was full on the crust and not on the fish.\n\nGot me thinking, is the same person frying the calamari and the fish? Or the batter was too clumped up?\n\nEither way, I know PS 310 will get there. I am just glad that they are in CC so we don't have to drive all the way to DTLA.\n\nWill be back again and hopefully, I will update this review with 1 or 2 more stars.",

Saw her two more times for dessert (not great) and the check.\n\nThe beer tasted watered down so it was OK, nothing special. The food was tasty and I had leftovers which I took to work. When I transferred my food to a plate to heat up, there was a long and black hair that had been sitting at the bottom of my meal. GROSS!!!   The worst part is not knowing if the hair was there during dinner or in the box it got put into. I immediately threw it away and bought lunch.\n\nI will not return until I'm over my traumatic experience.",

Out of me and my friends, we have all sampled just about everything On the menu. Delicious!! Mac n cheese is bomb!! It's SO creamy and love the chips they put on top to add a little crunchy! I finished my salmon before everyone else finished their meals, SO GOOD! Can't wait to go back! Also, the fried fish tacos on the appetizer menu are out of this world!",

                  "review": "First time here.  Was a little put off by the Yelp reviews about long waits and spotty service.  Went on a Saturday at 1 pm with 2 others.  No wait, seated on enclosed, heated patio. Great decor.  Here's the scoop:\n\nMenu-excellent choices for all who eat food. EXCELLENT beer selection (draft and bottle) and the BEST of all is they will bring FREE samples of any beer you like.  They offer FREE still or sparkling water.\n\nFood: I can only report on the lamb burger because all 3 of us ordered it.  We all ordered MEDIUM RARE and they all arrived MEDIUM WELL.  However, the burger was so tasty I can only imagine it would be twice as good if the kitchen could figure out how to correctly cook it. The bun was excellent and the tomato jam was the perfect condiment.  I got the fries, my dining companions had the quinoa salad.  The fries were fresh potatoes with the skin, cooked to a nice crispy texture-but they were oversalted (this is from a person who enjoys salt).  The quinoa salad was very good.\n\nService: Excellent. Friendly accommodating, knew the menu and the beers.\n\nOverall 4 stars.  I knocked off 1 for the over cooked burgers-come on grill guy/girl-get it right-the lamb deserves your love!",

My daughter and I went last week for lunch because a co-worker raved about this place. I immediately yelped it to get a feel for it though pictures and knew we would enjoy the food. We were definitely not disappointed. My daughter got the fish 'n chips  and I ordered the braised short rib tacos and they were honestly some of the best taco's I have ever eaten. The beef was tender and flavorful paired with the pickled onions on top....each mouthful made you just want to smile. Our waitress was very attentive and super friendly. There were two guys seated next to us and we noticed him looking and finally he asked if the tacos were good? and that he wanted to order them but hadn't. I told him, they were better than good and he should get them next time he comes. I can't wait to go back.",

                  "review": "We waited a couple weeks after Public School opened when the crowds had died down and we were actually able to get a table at 4pm for happy hour, quaintly called \"recess.\"  We ordered tacos, mushroom lavash pizza, spring rolls, and calamari.  Service was impressive, with 3-5 different waitresses tag-teaming to refill, check in, and bring out dishes.  \n\nUnfortunately, nothing was that tasty and everything was spicy.  Even the beer, an amber ale, was spicy.  I'm sure I would've enjoyed the hefeweizen better but it wasn't included in the happy hour prices.  Did I mention everything was spicy?  Yes, spicier than the happy hour dishes at Kay and Dave's Mexican food down the street.  \n\nThe spring rolls were full of noodles and not much else, the pizza was garlicy, and I would have loved to order the peanut butter and jelly sliders but the waitress warned me that by sliders they meant hamburgers and not the delicious pb&j I might have been expecting.  \n\nYes, the place is cool and hip and the indie jams playing sound like they could be found on my iPod but I think next time I would opt for Ugo down the street which is a bit less hip but has tastier food and better beer.    Prices were reasonable.",

Lots of atmosphere, comfortable and casual and hip.\n\nThe food was unique and generous portions. Get the salmon sandwich (mmm!!! amazing). The only point of improvement that I noticed is that the fries were greasy and hard - could be better; and the quinoa salad could do without the cheese. (Very special that the quinoa salad is offered as an alternative to the fries...I like to be healthy! Would only ask that they also offer fruit as an alternative, because not everyone likes quinoa salad and fruit would have been very refreshing alongside the salmon).",

Usually I'd hesitate yelping anything that may cost someone their job, but if these chics are so miserable here they shouldn't be working the front of the house. Asian chic gave me attitude right when I walked up and later I caught the dark haired girl in the striped shirt giving straight NASTY looks to my gf when she asked about our table AND when she seated us... I live in Culver and my friends and I frequent downtown and this place. Honesty, I'd hesitate taking them here again if I thought I had to deal with these awful hostesses.",

Servers are fairly professional and friendly.  A little bit of a Hollywood (read: exclusive) vibe, so it's not that appealing to someone like me who works nearby and just wants an easy lunch.

The chicken was lightly fried and the waffle was the real star of the show. It was made of cornbread with corn and other taste delights inside. This dish came with an egg atop and gravy. I passed on the gravy but I can imagine that it would have really made the dish savory as opposed to sweet, which is the way I had the dish. Overall it scored a 4 for me. Will return soon.",

I sent it back and by the time a new one was brought to me I could've written a 1000 page novel and my friend was completely done with her lunch. The manager comp'd our meal and all was forgiven. The next, and what is now definitely my last time to go to Public School 310, the hostess told my friend and I the wait would be about 15 minutes for both the patio and inside. After a half hour we asked her for an update... She swore up and down she never told us that; insisting in a most condescending way that she said the wait was 45-50 minutes. We said forget it and walked away. Bye bye Public School. We've graduated and moved on to other establishments!",

We made reservations and were seated as soon as we got  there - which I always appreciate. Our table ordered shrimp & grits, short rib, stuffed poblano with quinoa. Everything we ordered was delicious.  We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday and mentioned this to our waiter. He gave us a choice of desserts and then later we saw that we were charged. I think that's fine but I think he should have told us. Note to waiter: by doing it that way, you failed to ask anyone else at the table if they wanted dessert.  Next time I suggest you direct guests celebrating that when everyone orders dessert, they  would be happy to add a candle for the birthday boy/ girl. We will definitely be back",

Both burgers were super delicious and rather large.  We had split the burgers in halves and took each half. I couldn't finish either of my halves, probably because we had two orders of the most amazing tater tots ever.  Not only do they have cheese and bacon inside, the outside is crisped perfectly.  Definitely a great pairing with beer.  Will be back for \"recess\" in the near future.",

The first time was for dinner, we sat outside and we're served promptly and everything was tasty. The second time was for happy hour with some friends who we're visiting from out of town.\nNow I understand that happy hour is open seating at shared tables, but we arrived somewhat early (5ish) and all the tables were being hogged by small groups of people who claimed to be \"waiting for others\" or acting like Mean Girls \"you can't sit with us\". One large table had only two ladies sitting and to be polite I asked, \"do you mind if we sit here?\". They just looked at each other and back at us to say \"Umm .... Yeaaa kind of\". We got the message, and left after that.\nEven though this bar/restaurant is walking distance from my house, I'm never setting foot in there again.",

It has a slight European beer tent feel in the front, and then cozy feeling booths/tables in the back.  The wait was a little long for a weeknight, but I'm sure that's because it has just recently opened.  \n\nMy friend and I each had the burger...which was just phenomenal.  Great meat, good bun, the right amount of pungent cheese.  I love that this place offers quinoa as a side instead of fries.  Why don't more restaurants offer healthy options like this??\n\nThey specialize in beers and have a ton on tap.  When we had trouble deciding between beers, they brought out small little samples for us to taste.  Loved that.\n\nI'll be back for sure.",

We eventually set the menus down, but still nothing. The two waitresses kept walking past us. We would make eye contact and everything short of actually saying \"excuse me, we have been sitting here and no one said anything to us yet.\" So of course we left. The food/menu looked good!

But I had heard very good reviews about the food and I actually like the lively atmosphere so I'd always wanted to come back and actually dine.\n\nAs I'd heard, the food was very good.  My entire group all seemed happy with their meals overall.  Of particular note seemed to be the fish and chips, the short ribs, and the vegetarian red lentil bolognese which is what I got.  As a vegetarian it was nice to be able to get a full, quality meal at a Gastropub.  It was delicious! And the portion was huge :-)\n\nWhat I really wanted to review though was the service I received: it was superb.  It was my birthday dinner, and I waited too long to make my reservation for such a large party in the first place so the fact that they accommodated taking my group at all was excellent. Then my party ended up being larger than I thought it was going to be so part of my party had to wait to be seated. But the hostesses and the server all worked diligently to make sure my entire party was seated as quickly as possible. And then my server - whom I believe his name was Aaron - just did a fantastic job. We were a large party, no mistakes were made, food was received at about the same time so we were all eating together, everything just went so smoothly.  And when I couldn't eat the dessert because it contained bacon, he actually brought a plate with three candles on it to sing happy birthday & so I could blow out some candles.\n\nWe happily left a generous tip because it was a fantastic night.  Many thanks to the folks at Public School 310.",

With the name of Public School, they match the theme of the restaurant with even their menus and titles.  Their menu is in a composition notebook style, happy hour is called Recess, and shared drinks are listed under Study Group.  It's cute.  It definitely feels like a gastropub and I wish they'd name something fun detention, because I was a goody goody growing up and wouldn't mind a walk on the wild side. ;-)  Everyone here seems happy, often there are a lot of large groups, and it also seems like a good date spot.  (We've been here once for a brunch date and enjoyed ourselves.)  We have only sat on the outside patio, where it is good people watching and you can enjoy the air outside.  Inside, seems to be a little loud and more intimate.  (I've only walked through to the restroom though.)\n\nSERVICE:  Always friendly, even when busy.  The hosts/esses get a little slammed at times, but are pleasant during the busy hours (should we say passing period? Hah!).  They were accommodating when we requested an outside table after they first attempted to seat us at a large communal table in the bar.  (For a table of 4, we were looking to be able to talk and it is a little louder inside.)  We've had great servers every time, laughing and joking while still getting our orders out to us.\n\nFOOD & DRINKS:  For brunch, we've enjoyed the croquet madame and chicken & waffles.  We also had to try the speck & eggs, because I'm a sucker for deviled eggs.  For dinner, I cannot recall all of the items the 4 of us enjoyed; I know we definitely had the Irish stout ribs and flat iron steak, and feel like we got specials of some sort that I can't find on the online menu.  No one was dissatisfied with their food in either of our visits and I definitely know that there was not much left on any plate after our meals.  During brunch, we had bloody Mary's and mimosas (carafes at $10 each!!!); for dinner, we enjoyed cocktails, vino, and beer.  They have a decent array of beer choices for the guys, giving it the gastropub feel.  We didn't add desert because we planned to head across the street to the Culver Hotel and we didn't have apps because we went to Bottle Rock while we waited.  We will be back to try desserts and enjoy Recess. =)\n\nBATHROOMS:  You have to go out the back and I believe they are shared bathrooms with other local spots, but they're clean.  (This is a new area I've decided to add to my reviews and I think it is important, especially for the ladies!)\n\nBottom Line - Fun spot to go for various occasions including dates, double dates, happy hour (recess), or other casual celebrations.  And now, as I write this, I think we are due for another visit...",

I got the Kale Salad with Salmon it was freaking delicious a must try. To everyone that comes on yelp and adds comments like \"this place is kind of expensive\" it's not like you eat here every day. It's not like you're back in school and paying for lunch day after day. I'm not the richest guy in the world but Im so open minded ill give anything a try regardless of price specially food. And if thats one of your reasons to complain than MCDONALD'S is around the corner and every off ramp. If your wondering my meal alone came to $28.10 and a great tip.",

Ordered the steak, where a huge artery was in it, absolutely disgusting. We asked for another steak, and then saw our waiter speaking with the rude waitress who seated us, about us! At least go in the back if you're going to talk about your customers. Will not be returning to this restaurant again.",

If it was delicious I wouldn't care but it was Luke warm and for the price ($40) I was very underwhelmed. This place gets two stars, one for the service and one for the atmosphere. In terms of food and value, those are where the stars are docked. The last docked star is for the wait. Like I said, Overrated.",

Public School 310 is here for you.\n\nThis is great new spot in Culver City and I believe these guys will go far.  Friendly staff, interesting drinks, and solid food.

The waiter assured our food was coming and that the delay is due to a holiday(Presidents Day). He noticed others getting served their food and scurried away. Then a random person shows up and asked if I was okay. I obviously said no because I've been waiting for so long. (later I learned he was actually a manager. I recommend better training) I asked why our food was so late & he said that their POS system was down and delayed orders. I would believe that story if the other people were waiting just as long as we were. Anyway, I got the crispy burger it was ok, fries mediocre both not worth waiting over 30 minutes for it. the amount of effort in fixing their mistake was a joke. I got a $6 desert to comp their mishap.",

My first bite of the salad included a piece of chicken! I told the waiter, who said it was probably just a noodle, and took it back to the kitchen to make sure it didn't have chicken. He came back with the same salad and said they did not include chicken. I picked through my salad carefully and took out a few pieces of chicken along the way, and then just stopped eating. When the waiter came back, I pointed out there was definitely chicken in the salad, and he said \"Honestly that's just the noodles, but sorry if a little bit chicken got in there.\" At this point, my friend picked up a piece of chicken from my plate to show it to him clearly to his face. Umm Excuuuuseee me... don't try to tell me that the chicken in this salad is \"honestly a noodle?!\" We asked to speak to the manager who was super nice and apologized, offered me more food, and a gift card-- as he should. But please, train your waitstaff not to be rude, inconsiderate, and do not try to convince a vegetarian that she did not just eat a piece of meat when it's your fault.",

We were seated promptly and enjoyed the \"school\" motif. My friend ordered a gin martini andI ordered a taste of a beer because (to my annoyance) they are trying to be trendy with craft beers no one has ever heard of. We searched the menu and decided upon our choices...Fish and chips for me and deviled eggs and baked cauliflower. After 20 minutes we still had not been served our drinks.\nAfter flagging down our waitress, (we were approached by 3 different ones so was not sure which one was ours) Finally approaching 25 minutes after ordering our drinks arrived. I did not care for the beer I tasted so went with their recommendation  I waited on my beer...... Entrees were served  BEFORE I EVEN GOT MY BEER. I had food in front of me and nothing to drink. We began to eat and time passed....no beer. I had had enough. Found the manager, explained the problem. He said he would take care of it. Back to table...waited..... I pushed the barely eaten fish and chip to the side and told the waitress to take them away. No beer=no food!!! Manger comes to table WITHOUT MY BEER and asks what was wrong with the fish and chips? Nothing I said but we have been here 40 minutes and I STILL HAVING NOTHING TO DRINK!!!! I told him we were NOT paying of anything and we would NEVER return. He comped the entire check,. I left hungry.\nI will NEVER return to this amateur operation.",

Main courses arrive before starters, in fact main courses arrive before silverware. Pointed out the breakdown to staff who were sweet and responsive, but management needs to ensure customers don't get to that point to begin with.\n\nWhen it all finally pulled together the food was really good. Tots, burgers, great quinoa salad as a side, cauliflower gratin all good.\n\nHad a second round of drinks and while I am never looking for a handout it would have been appropriate to have a drink or a starter comped as a courtesy given the breakdowns in service.\n\nGood food though.",

We ordered the broccolini as an appetizer, we never got it. 2 out of three of us got our food, while the third waited for a solid 5 minutes before his arrived, COLD. When we asked what happened to the broccolini, the response was, \"oh, they never got it.\" um...Who is \"They???\" Why didn't \"they\" get it??? and what are you gonna do about it?? No apologies were made. When our order of fries came, it was an assortment of bottom of the bag over fried short stubs of what once were fries. It looked like they emptied the old oil fry bin for us. When we spoke with the manager, his response was, \"oh. I wish someone would've told me earlier.\" Ok....well, someone told you now...\nGranted, he did take the cold burger off the bill, but where is the quality control in this establishment? Do they just let anything come out of the kitchen? To make matters worse, the waitress just went MIA after the burger and broccolini incident, only to reappear at the end of our meal asking if everything was going okay...as if nothing ever happened. The hostess was the one doing all her dirty work. The food is ok, but the entire experience was just an overall fail. Just another LA restaurant that focuses more on being aesthetically pleasing than anything else.",

I wanted to stick to light dishes so I ordered two appetizer type plates which were enough to get full. The two dishes I did get were really good. I got the tuna tacos, which I highly recommend.  It comes with four mini tacos that are stuffed and very filling since I was the only one eating them. They might be a small portion for an appetizer if you're splitting them. Then I ordered the Grilled Watermelon & Heirloom Tomato Stack Salad. The portion is actually fairly big and chunky.  It was a cute little spot for a bite and a beer.  I also suggest you try the White Ale beer. Super refreshing!!! Cool ambience and medium dim lighting so it's cozy. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't out of this world but I would definitely go back and recommend it to friends on a weeknight.",

It had bitter taste consisting mostly of cole slaw with a few small shrimp and nut shavings, no noodles to be found. Did not have desserts, but they looked really decadently good. Water served in glass bottles at room temperature, we had to ask for ice. They also serve the tiny coke bottles. Might return to see if other salads and pizzas improve rating",

My 8 year old ordered off of the kids menu, $9 for a small crock of pasta that probably was worth $.75 and that's it, no veggies no fruit. Her dinner came out about 25 minutes before ours. She's learning table manners and despite us encouraging her to go ahead and start, she politely waited and ended up eating a cold dinner;( Husband ordered the special, which was Sausage shaped as a burger served on a burger bun, why not just make sausage? I ordered shrimp and grits. There was about 3mm of grease on top of this thing, flavor was good, I picked at the shrimp but just couldn't do it, way too oily. Didn't see our server forever, would have loved to have ordered 1-2 more beers and maybe get something different to eat , but never got the chance, and of course no one noticed that I barely touched my meal and just took it away as though I was finished. There too much good food in LA to mess with this place again, if I do come back it will just be for a beer at the bar, maybe two if anyone bothers to ask if I'd like another. Oh well, not everything can be .",

Once our server Aaron did come he was very dry (meaning no connection at all) it was very clear we were not familiar with the place so you'd think he'd be warmer. The menus and cute setup made him more tolerable lol. Now to the best part I ordered a whiskey sour, and jungle juice (yes I was pretty tipsy) and for my meal I had fish n chipz! Those 3 golden stars are simply due to the food! There wasn't much variety for chicken/turkey eaters so I was forced to the cod and fries. It was AMAZING though. If you go don't count on good service but you can count on the chef!",

Plenty of restaurants and bars and always tons of people inhabiting them.\nPublic School 310 is one of these many places and certainly towards the top. The place is no secret and tends to get crowded but for good reason. They have a good wines, unique cocktails and a solid beer selection to go along with delicious food. Boys, ladies LOVE this place! If you're looking for a date spot I would recommend PS 310. Come for lunch and sit on the patio or enjoy the cool atmosphere inside. Either way it's a good time.\nBig booze servings to split with buddies, small plates to start with (I gotta recommend the cutting board and bacon cheddar tots), big juicy burgers, good salads and a handful of other entrees that must be good because this place is never empty.\nGood drink, good food and always a good crowd.",

I orderd my favorite Kale Cesar Salad thru her and it was like asking her to donate a lung to me. She was lazily taking my order, didn't put it to the window quick enough, sluggish to respond and just not into working today. Hey...if you don't like your job, quit and move on.

Unfortunately, their food misses the mark.\n\nThis is really disappointing, because the quality of the ingredients is clearly very good. The easily fixable, but apparently longstanding problem is that almost everything was underseasoned. Adding a little salt helped, but it seems like they either do not taste their food, or they don't know what seasoning is.\n\nThe beet salad was the tastiest thing we had. Everything on the mezze plate was quite bland, and  although the baba was not bad, and the chickpeas would have been very good if they were seasoned. The housemade pita was the best thing we ate, and I think that if they just served that and beer, they would get five stars.\n\nThe taco plate had heat, but little flavor, and the deviled eggs had no taste at all, save for the little speck chip.\n\nI see that the management has reached out to some of the reviews, which is nice, but clearly, they need to work on making more flavorful food.",

Bar service was incredibly slow, and it's not because they were making Other drinks... Just talking together. Eventually we get seated, about 15-20 minutes went by before a waitress greeted us. We asked Kelly the hostess where our server was and she apologized and went to find her, she came back to say that our waitress was swamped and that SHE would be happy to take our order, the hostess. She mentioned it was her second day there. Eventually long after we ordered, our real waitress came. She claimed \"our waitress had left for the evening and she would be taking over\" funny cause she was serving all the other tables in our section so she just made a up a lie in order to not look like she completely forgot us. Then, our appetizer never came out and we had to ask again for that. Our waitress didn't notice it had taken exceptionally long to get cauliflower, but good old kelly did and she handled it and apologized. Again, waitress didn't notice nor apologize. Kelly was our only waitress that mattered, the other one hardly said a word to us or checked on us once. If I had cash, I would have left no tip on my check and handed it all to kelly. But, even with shitty service I can't leave no tip- so hopefully this gets Kelly the credit she deserves on her second day.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nGrill Concepts Team\nBusiness Manager\n7/1/2016\nSimone,\n\nI am sorry to hear about your poor experience.

No reservations for 6 or more, especially at the communal tables where happy hour applies, but we got there at 5:30 on a Tuesday (also after a long holiday), and had no problem securing one big table.  \nThe happy hour drinks and food are always a hit, but the highlight of the meal was our server.  I'm kicking myself for not getting his name, but he had sandy blondish hair, kinda long but pulled back, and some scruffy facial hair.  We almost never had to look around to find him, he accommodated everyone's separate checks by memory, and was always making sure to replace dirty plates and make sure we were comfortable.  I and many of my guests work in the restaurant industry, so these are things we notice and really appreciate.  Kudos to him for making it a smooth evening, it really stood out and made my birthday very enjoyable!",

I was expecting something like I'd get in the south, but the dish was prepared more like polenta than like grits. You can fry polenta. Grits are the consistency of oatmeal. Anyway, not a reason to take off two stars.\n\nThe dish was bland. It needed salt, and the salt shaker on the table had been out in the humidity too long, so I couldn't get any. It was also small, and definitely not worth $15, as it only had 5 baby shrimp in it (grits are cheap! SO CHEAP!).\n\nWhile our server was helpful, the service was SLOW. When you come on a weekday for lunch, you shouldn't have to wait more than 15 minutes for your food once you've ordered. We waited 45. Good thing I had the day off.\n\nProbably won't come back.",

(Thai rooster sauce mixed with ketchup)\n\nI had the huntsman burger and the all american burger.  i would suggest the huntsman because the cheese was yummy.  I also had the jidori chicken....I would suggest this over the two hamburgers.  Expertly cooked and the white beans and kale...it complimented the dish perfectly. The chicken was also crispy and so juicy.\n \nI'm a huge beligian beer fan and they managed to snag the bar manager of Wurst Kuche venice so they definitely have that detail taken care of....all the usual great suspects in terms of beer.\n\nDesert.....all three are great but the peanut butter and jelly cookie was amazing.\n\nThe staff was great.....all charming, good looking and sweet people and the food came out perfectly timed despite being a new place.\n\nMy only niggle and I was told they are still sorting it....the fries.\nThey taste like in and out fries which I really don't like.  But they have this great aforementioned sriracha ketchup that really saves the day.  You almost want to keep eating the okay fries to eat the sauce. It wasn't enough for me to dock them a point.\n\nBeing a Culver City local I am really happy to have new place that gives me an excuse to not have to leave my hood.",

Bullsh1t.  I've had enough beer in my time to know when they're just not doing it right.  (And, if they're going to be that pretentious, how about serving the different styles in the appropriate glassware?)\n\nYesterday, I ordered a Hefeweizen, and it arrived in the same 5/6 pint glass, with hardly any head, and about two fingers short.  Super duper beer snob fail.  And all that for $8.  \n\nThe food is average gastropub fare, btw.  Service the first time was pretty bad, the second time adequate.\n\nAlso, their happy hour menu only applies to the bar area, not to the \"dining\" area, even though there's little to separate them.  Just stupid and cheap on their part.\n\nPlenty of good places to eat around there:  go somewhere else.",

I'm not a burger type of gal so I wish they had more variety besides the fish and chips that I always have to end up getting.Their french fries are amazing, and their home made ketchup has an interesting and nice kick to it. My boyfriend always gets burgers here and raves about them every time, and he is very picky with his burgers! Great service as well, the waiters are very down to earth. Overall a great staple in downtown Culver.",

We actually sent the beet salad back because it was all arugula and minimal beets.  \n\nMy friend thought the music was too loud and requested that they turn it down -- they told her no.  Ironically another friend who went there a few weeks ago also requested that the music be turned down and was also refused by management.  \n\nI liked the ambiance of the place but it's certainly not enough to bring me back.",

Greasy, pub type food, but hey we can't eat healthy all the time, fish and chips decent with as others have said a very thick batter so be prepared to peel it off and eat the cod which was really good or have some of the batter just enough to not clog your arteries, the bacon cheese tator tots do not have the tater tot outside. It is more of a panko type breading and the potatoes are shredded. Very greasy, but it is tator tots. The siracha sauce is yummy. The flatbread with mushrooms and cheese is not too bad, nice snack. The ceasar salad dressing is better than your average dressing, but it was just a salad with romaine and kale, nothing that special. Overall an ok place.",

                  "review": "I'm a native to Culver City, so I've watched Downtown transform from thrift stores and run-down businessmen to trendy bars and eateries. Naturally, when Public School 310 opened, I felt is was my duty to check it out.\nI went for drinks and eats with some friends a couple weeks after it opened. It's the perfect location for this place which used to be a hoity-toity French restaurant. I'm a sucker for decor and little details like their composition book menus, so it was an instant win for me. We all got some beers and split the mouth-watering bacon cheddar tots, the cutting board and the brown bag fries. My friend is a beer fanatic and was very impressed with their selection, he was sure to talk our ears off about what came from where and why this is in that bottle. Whatever, they were delicious.\nThe place was a bit crowded, but I expect that is because it's a relatively new spot and word spreads fast. I'd love to sit down for an actual meal sometime in the near future, the burger looked out of this world.",

First, the servers are not always friendly or happy.  One (happy) exception to this is if you're lucky enough to get the bartender named Hilary (she might actually be a supervisor or manager).  She gets it as far as how to serve a customer----friendly (not fake or stuck-up like some of the older guy bartenders there), quick service and knowing when to check on your customer at just the right moments.  Too bad the other bartenders are too busy trying to get noticed by the Sony patrons for an \"acting\" job to take lessons on this.\n\nAs for the food, it is good but really overpriced and not really that special when you break it down.  Sure the cheese bacon tots are tasty but I could do the same thing at home with just a little bit of work and for less money.  Same with the deviled eggs and speck----great pairing but tiny portion for the price and again, it's just a boiled egg with bacon.  This place continues to remain packed (just like it's predecessor Fraiche did for it's first couple of year when it opened) but once the next new thing opens up in Culver City (and there will be something soon), I'm not sure it will be so packed anymore.  Go if you see Hillary otherwise grab a beer around the corner or down the street.  Your pocketbook will thank me.\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\n1/9/2013Previous review\nGoing to Culver City?  Like Father's Office? Rush Street? City Tavern? Can't tell them apart?  Well then here comes another ode to the \"hipster\" set with PS 310.  Taking over the space once occupied by Fraiche, this place has been updated nicely (yet somehow the dining room seems much smaller than before) with nice booths and a spiffy (always packed) bar.\n\nBeer and \"gastropub, fusion, innovative\" (have I used enough buzzwords yet?) are the key here.  The theme as you can guess revolves around school with the menus and even the napkins coming in that ruled-paper look/theme.  I was pleasantly surprised that the staff was quite friendly and relatively knowledgeable about their offerings (both beer and food) but that is what you should expect from the folks at the Daily Grill (who I believe run this place as well).  Happy Hour----called \"Recess\" (get the picture?) is decent but they only offer about 4 beers (rotating) from their draft selection on special each night.  HH food prices go for $4, 5 or 6 and were decently portioned but you won't get full from just one or 2 of these here.",

There were a few people outside on their patio. My lady and I sat at the bar and Jennifer quickly greeted us and took our order. We ordered their cauliflower bites, fennel and brussel salad, and adobo tacos. Everything was delicious. The cauliflower bites reminded me of tater tots, but I felt less guilty about them. They're fried with buffalo sauce and covered in a tasty breading. The crunch and flavors were so damn good. The other items were also tasty. The tacos were juicy and the chicken and short rib was tender, topped with pickled red onions and cheese. Because the salad was slow to arrive, she gave us a different salad on the house to enjoy while we ate. I think it had kale, cabbage, and red onions. She didn't have to do that, we weren't asking or wondering about the salad. We were just drinking and enjoying ourselves and were happy to be surprised with free food and such thoughtful service. We'll definitely be back as there are many additional items we'd like to try on their menu.",

A relatively low maintenance ask for a not so busy brunch service.  Our waiter seemed miffed by the request but said he would check. 15 mins later we flagged him down to refil our waters and asked about the chefs response.\n\n\"Ya That's a hard no on the eggs.\" He sneered. Uh ok 1. That's a ridiculous response 2. One of your customers has no ordered food, you rude dude. Our food came moments later and he didnt even attempt to get her an expedited order and she didn't get anything.\n\nThe whole service was bad, he never came around to refill coffees or water, he was directly gruff to all of us, and to top it off food was bad.",

I am a huge fan of creative and themed menus and public school has no shortage of ideas (some may say overkill, but i am in love with it).  The food was very tasty.  We couldn't decide what to order, so we did a bunch of sharing and couldn't complain with anything we ordered.  I don't remember which of their drink concoctions I decided to go with, but I was very happy with my choice.  We started out with \"cutting board\" for our appetizer and then shared the lamb burger (i love everything with brie on it!).  We also had a salad (the red quinoa i believe) and it was also really good.  I would definitely recommend this place.",

Too esoteric for its own good.  \n\nSpouse ordered fish and chips.  Came out not crunchy or tasty.  King's Head's fish and chips are way better.\n\nI ordered a burger....came out nothing near medium, was medium well.  Fries came out limp and cold.  They brought out more, and they were hot, crunchy and inedible.  Like the canned french fried we used to get.  No taste other than salt and the grease they were cooked in.  \n\nMust be kiddy day at the restaurant.  Two parties with babies sitting next to us. :(\n\nSkip it, and go to Rush Street for better food and service, served in a real pint glass.",

I will second what other reviews say: barely civil hostess, LOUD LOUD music. We had a table outside. The only positive thing I can say is that we were able to stay there about 3 hours and really catch up with our old friends. However, those steel stools are not too comfy for those of us who don't have well-padded rears.  I am not impressed by the loud traffic or the less than exciting people watching in Culver City.\nBack to the food: that potato salad is just weird. My so-called chopped antipasto salad was by far the worst I've ever had. One teaspoon of Burrata cheese and a sprinkling of bacon on top of undressed lettuce. I should have sent it back.\nThere are plenty more restaurants around, so go elsewhere.",

The happy hour (aka \"Recess\") was fun, although I don't doubt another reviewer's note about a fistfight nearly breaking out over the communal seating.\n\nThe bites and drinks here are nice and expectedly pretty fancy in a tongue and cheek way. The only big food mishap I had was this: they had regular beef sliders and then PB&J sliders on the happy hour menu. The PB&J sliders had bacon, which I thought a curious addition, but I asked if I could have it without. The waitress told me the happy hour foods are made in batches and can't be changed to order. I understood and said I could remove the bacon. When the food arrived, I was shocked. Am I insane, or if you do not mention beef in one set of sliders on the menu (but did on the other) would you expect beef? Furthermore, can you believe they serve beef sliders with PB&J and bacon? Even a high person would find that strange. I don't eat beef, so I was pretty pissed (but only showed my shock, not my pissed-offedness). The waitress said, \"Yeah, they have beef,\" and I could not believe I was the first person to make this mistake. She didn't offer a solution because my gracious tablemate said he'd eat them. I asked how they were and he said they confused the palate. No doubt!\n\nSeriously, here are the descriptions:\n   All American Sidekicks: three mini cheeseburgers with all the fixins\n   PB&J Sliders: blackberry habanero jam and smoked bacon\n\nIf you are looking for a fancy hipster bite, this is a good place. But beware that no matter what the description says, sliders mean beef, even if they also have PB&J&Bacon!",

There was a little bit of a wait (as expected for a Saturday), but once we got in we were greeted several times by staff and our waitress. The atmosphere is very hip and themed nicely throughout the space. The food was pretty good, a few items I didn't particularly like due to it being too spicy for my taste buds. So all in all I can't say anything bad about PS310. However, I do want to throw them a huge compliment for the way the handled an issue with our food. More than half way through my meal, my honey noticed an issue with my plate, nothing serious or anything to be concerned about. It was obviously an accident made by a chef. We notified our waitress, who then got the manager. I feel bad after all this time forgetting his name, but he handled the issue great. He looked at the the problem with my meal, apologized profusely, explained the likely possibility of how it happened, assured us it wouldn't happen again and he would talk to the chefs regarding the protocol. He even took the meal off our bill without hesitation or us complaining. What was extra special about the whole situation is how he continued to talk to us about our evening, what we were up to for the evening and starting suggesting beers. So many establishments act as though you, the customer, is a bother, burden, or wrong in a situation like ours, or don't care at all to begin with. But not PS 310, the manager was truly showing concern and then took it a step further to make our night as enjoyable as possible is top service.",

There was a very nice selection of craft beers that you won't find many places. I liked the selection of larger bottles that you can share with friends to try different beers and there is a nice selection of beers on tap. The girls seemed to be a fan of their cocktails, not sure exactly what they were but I'm sure all the drinks here are good. The atmosphere is good, was nice to be able to sit outside in downtown Culver City. It was very crowded outside as most bars tend to be on a Friday, but there are certainly worse places to go have some drinks with friends.",

Not to mention their great menu and very creative atmosphere, the food is something that will bring you much joy and a full stomach. When I first arrived I was in the mood for a hamburger, I ordered the Huntsman hamburger, and that blew me away. The taste of the burger drew me in like a mouse to a cheese trap. It was that good. I will definitely be returning soon.",

We made reservations, because driving by it, we could see how popular & busy they were.\nWe got to the restaurant at the appointed time .... and no.... table available.\nWe were asked to wait a few minutes and more minutes and more minutes. And the only place they could sit us was outside on a really cold day never mind the heater.\nWe decided to keep on waiting for an inside table, it was my girlfriend's b'day and we really wanted to give this restaurant a try.. Short story, the manager, Rob, was very apologetic and so professional in handling the problem with the reservations. He offered us a round of beer and appetizers on the house.\nNeedless to mention, this gesture made up for the inconvenience we suffered. The waiter, Daren, was knowledgeable in his recommedations of beers and was excellent with the service.\nFood: everyone ordered a different plate and we all liked it 100%\nDefinitely a place we would like to return to.\nI am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the reservations, but otherwise it would have been a 5 star.",

After initial pleasant greeting (and one menu delivered for the three of us) everything went downhill. The basics on bar service were so lacking that they almost defied explanation.\nOne bartender dropped three (YES 3!!) different glass items... one a full bottle of tequila which shattered across the bar. (Wouldn't be a good idea to change out the ice as much of the glass broke on the same side of the bar?)\nIt took three attempts to receive requested water (to accompany the wine and appetizers already ordered)\nFirst bartender never came back to take entree order though did have the time to entirely break-down the bar at 9:30 while the restaurant was still full. This included banging metal grates and glasses but amazingly not able to find the time to clear any of our meals including appetizers which were delivered 45 min earlier.\nThere were a total of 6 of us at the bar and 3 separate bartenders. (Where's the management?!!)\nSadly, our dinners became an afterthought, though lamb burger was properly cooked and pleasantly prepared. Salads and charcuterie were decent as well.\nAt least the kitchen went to \"school\"\nPlease, whoever is responsible for the bar service, take a 10 minute break and visit any of the Hillstone/Houston's/Bandera restaurants and take a tutorial on how to service your customers.",

The Allagash White Beer is never a dissapointment and this place offers great service. Our waitress was Venice - and she is probably one of the best servers I have ever came across. Highly enjoyed their menus on composition looking folders and highly enjoyed their napkins that looked like notebook paper. Fun! Good selection of alcohol, beer and wine.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered the Tuscan chopped salad - and this was probably one of the best salads I have ever had (I would not put celery in it, but that's just me). Dresisng was amazing, baby lettuce was awesome, and it is reccommended! We also ordered the Bacon Chedder Tater Tots with Siracha Ketchup. Yes. Doesnt that sound appealing? They were pretty damn good and so was the ketchup ( although I would of liked more of a bacon taste to them) and just a tip: They do crumble and there is not that many on the plate. I wish there was more! We ordered the Huntsman Burger and that was amazing. I have had some burgers in this city that I really like, and this one can be added to the list. The beef had a charbroiled taste and flavor to it that I really enjoyed. The fries were good - you can tell they used good oil to fry them up. But, I am not too paticular on them.\nHere is another update: Order the Kale Ceaser with Chicken. Amazing!!! Also, order the red smoke drink. Amazing!!! (If you like the smoky/spicy taste). Also, order the hummus appetizer which comes with naan bread and the crispy garbanzo beans (which are awesome). The feta is well aged (wish they gave more) and all three samples (Hummus, Babaganoush and tapanade) are great!",

We ordered the mezze plate as a starter to share between 3. The hummus, tapenade, crispy chick peas and there is a third dipping sauce that I cant remember but all of them were delicious and the bread was nice and warm, with the perfect char from the grill. I then went for the skirt steak and mac'n'cheese, has to be the best combination for me! The steak was a little over cooked for me but still juicy and tasty, the mac'n'cheese was excellent, the sauce was creamy and cheesy, just the way I like it and the chorizo and spinach through it just finished it off! my wife went for the fish and chips and said that it was really good. Our friend went for the fried chicken and cornbread waffles, which she also said was very good. The portion size for the fish and chicken were huge so we got a box to eat that later. The beer selection is ok and the cocktails my wife and her friend got were fruity, fresh and not overly strong. I don't know if it was just our waitress but she seemed distracted the whole time we were there, even after taking our order she seemed to stand and stare into space and then as if nothing happened go off to her next table. All in all I liked the place and I will be back no doubt in the near future.",

Our server was attentive, would just come by and talk to my friend and I and had a thorough knowledge of the beers.  We ordered the Allagash Curieux and it's become one of my top favorites - it's an ale aged in oak bourbon barrels and brought to you in a 750 ml bottle; perfect to share.  It's a good place to just chill and catch up with friends.",

I didn't try the other dishes that were ordered at our table, but I head satisfied grunts while they were inhaling their food.  I ordered the short rib with the mashed potatoes and would definitely recommend.  I can't wait to come back and try something different!",

The school vibe is seen through and though with composition notebook cover menus, use of blackboards, and other school related themes. I had their minestrone which was seasoned perfectly and came with some a tasty buttered type roll. The dish I had this evening was the Irish saloon short ribs. This dish had no bone, however if there was one it would fall off it. The super soft beef went perfectly with the cabbage, mashed potatoes, and gravy. I will come back to try another dish.",

The waiters leave a lot to be desired. I hate an absent waiter when it's not crowded. And don't even ask them to recommend anything bc all 3 different waiters made it seem like they were too cool to give me some suggestions. Overall it's a place you come to check out. But there's so many other options for dinner/drinks here. I'll always be puzzled by the long waits for this place.",

It was difficult to eat since all the pieces slide off from the burger but it was great.  The sauce was not overpowering, and it was just perfect.\n\nRed Quinoa Salad (came with burger) - I was hoping more for the salad, since there were so many positive reviews about it, but it was disappointing.  It was sour and for the most part bland.  I sprinkled salt/pepper into it but that didn't fix it.\n\nLemon Meringue ($6) - This was not good at all.  The lemon meringue was too tarty and sour.  The pecan-graham crust was uninspiring.  I wish I did not get this, because I would have rated the place higher if it weren't for this dessert.  SO disappointing.\n\nChocolate Stout Brownie ($7) - Too rich and heavy.  Also disappointing.\n\nCafe au Lait ($2) - I ordered a latte but on the receipt it said cafe au lait.  Regardless it was well made.  A fly flew in my cup halfway and I couldn't drink it anymore (we sat outside).  Though it is no fault of the restaurant, I did notice lots of flies.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe decor is great, everything is shiny, clean, and the amount of wood used in the space makes it a cozy setting.  The tables are arranged strategically so that it doesn't feel so tight.  We sat outside on the patio, and the roof goes all the way to the sidewalk, making a nice shade and no sunglasses necessary.  Good for friends, dates, clients.\n\nService:\nService for the most part was attentive, and our waiter was super friendly.  We totally were sold on his pitch on drinks/desserts, and although I didn't like the desserts, well we were totally fooled.\n\nPrice:\nThe food is appropriately priced given the location.  Also, you do get a lot of food.\nI don't plan on coming back, but I don't feel cheated.\n\nParking:\nFree first 2 hours at Trader Joe's parking on Washington.  $1/hour thereafter.\nStreet meter parking also available.\n\nLocation:\nOn Washington, alongside Menchies, and Native Foods.\n\nHighlights:\nNice decor.",

I called ahead to see what time they closed, because it wasn't posted on the website and the hours listed on Yelp are wrong, and they said kitchen closes at 10. And 927 we arrive and are asked whether we are here for dinner or just drinks, because the kitchen just closed, and I said.. Huh? I just called an hour ago and was told it was open until 11, and the host told me the manager decided to close the kitchen early since it had been slow as it is super bowl Sunday. But then she went to ask if they could accommodate us since I had called and was given the wrong information. So then we had dinner. My boyfriend got the bison burger rare.. It was cooked medium if that. I got the huntsman burger and was informed they changed it and no longer have the huntsman cheese, or any cheddar, so I got it with American, medium rare and it was medium well. I also got a Cosmo, which tasted like juice even though I got the well vodka, and didn't have that buzz feel you get from a Cosmo.. Must have been extremely short poured.",

I saw this restaurant and wanted to give it a try and have a salad sort of thing. It was a very pleasant experience. I liked the food and the service. Although it was a Sunday evening and usually restaurant are not busy. But Public School 310 was busy. Prices were not cheap, but I found it reasonable. The waiter, a young gentleman was very polite and professional. I liked his service. I will surely go back there again.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool",

Very cool ambiance, but either because it was restaurant week or other issues, we experienced very slow service and inattentive service. The Cesar salad actually came with an anchovy on top, which was a bit weird... With prior knowledge of this being a key ingredient, I've never seen them as a garnish... The Bison burger, however, was divine and worth the wait. Then came dessert...a brownie with a caramel stout sauce and ice cream. This was the description on the dineLA menu. When I took my first bite, I got a bit of a spice and discovered there was chiptole spice hidden in the brownie and as a garnish on my ice cream! Aldo, NO caramel sauce. This was weird for me and unexpected. After inquiring, the manager informed me that she liked it that way and its a nice surprise to have a spicy brownie...yeah if it is described like that! I wouldn't have picked it , had I known. My friend got the peanut butter and jelly cookies with milk and those were inedible. I want to see if this place can redeem my experience another time but I will not be ordering a salad or dessert.",

The menu is well-balanced with something for everybody.  The bar is well-stocked and very friendly - Brandon, our very able and friendly waiter, brought a taste of a Scotch to see if my gf would like it [she didn't].  The food is superlative - she had a pan-seared salmon which was extremely crispy and yet marvelously moist and flavorful.  I had the braised short-ribs w/ shaved horseradish, mashed potatoes and au jus.  I can honestly say these may have been the very best short ribs I have had.   I highly recommend this restaurant and we will be back.",

Why a seemingly nice restaurant would hire someone with trashy tattoos (I like tattoos but hers were just TRASHY) and a face that looks like its not even capable of a smile is beyond me. After my party was seated out waitress approached us quickly and gave us a menu, we needed more time to look over but when we finally were ready and tried to signal to her that we wanted to order we were basically ignored for almost 10 minutes. Had my party and I not been so hungry we would have gotten up and found somewhere else to eat. If you want good service do not eat here!!",

A delicious ground chicken burger (why don't more places do ground chicken instead of ground turkey?? It's so much juicier and more flavorful) topped with bacon, blue cheese and avocado on a DELICIOUS bun!!! I'm craving it again and again. Choose either their perfectly crispy home cut fries (Jesus this is what I wish in n out fries taste like but they still could use some salt) paired with their simple but delish sriacha ketchup or the surprisingly tasty red quinoa salad and I'm extremely happy. It can get a little busy so if you want your first experience to be unsullied, go on a weekend in the early afternoon.",

The last time we went however, there was a major problem in the kitchen and our food took over an hour to come out.  One person in our party had an event to go to and his food came out about 20 minutes after the other food.  The server apologized and took the entree off the bill.  They also brought complimentary bacon tater tots (which are AMAZING!) It was clear that there was a major problem, so we weren't too irked, but I wish the server had come out and let us know there was a problem 30 minutes before she did.\n\nRE: food, I usually get one of the burgers and I am always pleased.  The fries are excellent too.  We love this place mostly for the beer/wine selection and cocktails.\n\nOne last comment- inthe past, I was on a number of restrictive diets, so I am very sensitive to food allergies, etc.  I could tell immediately from looking at the menu that if you have any sensitivities, allergies, etc., this is not the place for you.",

This place has wide selection of liquor and fresh-squeezed juice. My friends and I ordered salmon (over fried rice), short ribs, and lamb bolognese. The lamb dish was the most tasty one among all three. Salmon dish obviously has Asian influence - pretty good but not amazing. Short ribs are super tender but a bit plain for my liking. They were, however, laid over a bed of mashed potato containing wasabi! I loved the mashed potato. Next time I'll try the huge burgers. I have a feeling that the three-star review might not do justice to the burgers - they look GOOD!",

We waited a long time just to get beers. They were also out of nearly everything I ordered. I would have to ask for 3 different drinks just to find one that was still available. I will have to come back before I can judge any further since I think they were caught off guard by the crowds.",

It seems that the DTLA PS location has better HH deals, b/c the hostess mistakenly gave me the HH menu for the DTLA location, and it was a lot cheaper than the HH in Culver City and had a better variety of appetizers to choose from.",

I'm very big on service and the fact it took 30 min for drinks, and hour for our food to come and then another 25 mins for the bill to come back when they took our card is just plain RIDICULOUS.",

I hadn't either, until 2 nights ago when we were having a party at this place for a friend of mine. Apparently the place was out of seating (which seems to be a recurring issue after reading the reviews) and the manager himself came out and said that we need to give up 2 of our seats. My party was there for about 1:30hr at the time, so it's not like they were there for several hours or anything like that. The manager's excuse was that we had borrowed 1 seat from another table and that somehow he needed 2 back - that's right... it made no sense. He kept apologizing and couldn't make a real argument about how he's asking seated customers to vacate their seats for others but he wouldn't let it go. The party was ruined, we paid our bill and left. He gave us a $20 credit. Most horrible experience ever. If the manager reads this then please reply in public and give a legit reason and thought process behind your actions that night - I can't and thus can only think of them as grossly unprofessional and quite frankly insulting.",

The bacon-cheddar tater tots are amazingly crispy on the outside and pillowy on the inside, complimented with a just-spicy-enough kick by the sriracha ketchup.

The first time we opted to sit outside and had an overly chipper server, which I appreciate, even though others in our group thought it was over the top. I felt like a plate of fried food to accompany my  Delirium so I opted for the fish and chips. The fish and chips were standard and nothing amazing. We also ordered the bacon cheddar tots, which were good. I mean, tots with bacon, how can you go wrong? On the second visit it wasn't such a great experience. We were sat inside and apparently we didn't have a dedicated server to our table. First, it took a long time for someone to take our drink orders, then another server took our food orders. I had the pan seared salmon which was moist and flakey, but the dish as a whole was bland. We waited and nobody came to check on us. Our water glasses sat empty and even worse we needed more beer. We kept waiting until we finally flagged someone down to get our server. I watched the person go back and speak with someone else and nobody could figure out who our server was. At this point I really just wanted the check to get out of there quickly as we were waiting for so long. The place wasn't even busy and yet we were ignored and it took three people to figure out what to do with us. I would go back again, but my last visit really left a poor impression. There are many other beer and food options where I have had better food and service.",

The dressing and condiments were too too much for the sandwich and the bread was too much. There wasn't a balance to the sandwich, which caused me to eat it with a knife and fork. The fries were greasy and soggy and luke warm but they were shoe string. Either they were not fried in hot enough oil or it was cooked for long enough, but it wasn't good. Perhaps the beers are good but I'm not drinking a beer for lunch when I'm not on vacation.",

Restaurant is meant to remind you of school; with composition book menus, and things like microscopes and times table flash cards as part of the decor. We didn't have drinks here but they seem to have an impressive  selection. Table service was was friendly. I had the kale Cesar salad with chicken which was a rather small portion and drenched with too much of what tasted like Dijon mustard and garlic. The shredded chicken in it tasted very fresh, but overall would not recommend.  My friend had the lamb burger which she liked but wasn't too impressive. I hate the idea of people eating lamb anyway and think this whole meat meat meat trend in gastro-pubs is a little much. Ginger Ale in a small bottle cost almost $3.00. Will come back and try \"recess\" ( happy hour).",

The food is pretty good and the menu is rather eclectic but has some good items here and there.  The happy hour is legit but it gets incredibly packed (even during the week) so you'll have to take your chance.  Around Culver City, it is probably the best quality food you'll find in my opinion.  I do wish the service was better however.  I've saw one server completely run into an old man and keep on walking while he looked down at his notepad.  It was even more off putting when he did the same thing 5 minutes later in the same spot (right by the bar) as he knocked into some girl.  Pretty off putting but can't knock the restaurant for one douchey server.",

We had to wait 30 minutes and we just walked around waiting for them to call us in. All the restaurants looked very good and were all busy. Anyway, the beers we got were OK (neither my boyfriend nor I really liked my fruity IPA, but his hefeweiser was good as always), the G+T I got was delicious; my kale salad was really really good and his fish and chips were OK but the fish was a bit soggy, not so nice and light/crispy. I did appreciate that it was served on a newspaper-print paper. The bacon cheddar tots didn't really taste so cheddar-y or bacon-y...but no matter it was still delicious, crunchy fried goodness. Siracha-ketchup was a winner.",

The service is on par with what it is, craft food and cocktails. MADE TO ORDER people which means IT TAKES TIME and is not batched. The cocktails are delicious and there's always a special of one or two cocktails/food items each week. They infuse their own bitters and alcohol with a bunch of flavors which makes coming here and drinking a new experience every time, and truly shows that this company knows what they are doing (talented mixologist, hard to find these days!). I try and sit at the bar (limited seating) so I can chit chat with the bartenders who actually know what they are serving. Management is always attentive on the floor and I like that I see them every time I am there, they must be doing something right! I keep coming back!\n\nbut alas I must say,\n\nI laugh at reviews of people complaining of waiting, but what good restaurant do you not need to wait to eat at on a weekend or even a busy weeknight?",

But finally decides to pay a visit and the place is very dim lit but has a very calm, relaxing, beautiful look to it! It's pretty loud but not loud enough to where you can't hear the waiter or whoever you're dining with! The menu was very NEW to me, wasn't familiar with anything they served other than Fish & Chips so I got that and a lemonade. Food came in good timing and it tasted very RARE in a very positive way! The sauces I had with the Fish really popped and had my tastebuds going! Can't wait to visit again and try something NOT SO FAMILIAR LOL!",

But on this night, I decided to take a walk over to Public School 310, and being honest with myself, and my appetite, I wasn't expecting much out of the visit, perhaps a beer and some bar food, after all I was just looking to appease my appetite. Once arrived although, I was HUMBLY greeted by the host, which was a welcoming surprise considering yelp describes this place as a gastropub/bar. As I was guided to the table, the smells of the kitchen started to surround me, and my GPS search was telling me I made the proper decision. It was the perfect amount of time between the point at which I sat and was able to look at the menu, that I was greeted and ready to be served, and although the place was incredibly busy it was nice to know they have service willing to give everyone an excellent experience. I ordered a beer, of course, because their beer selection astounded me, this wasn't your typical 10 beer joint, and after all I came for a cold one. Moments later I was delivered the beer (yet again quick service) and was ready to order my dinner. I ordered the chef special, which was the salmon farrotto. I always feel if you are going to give a place a run for its money you may as well order what the chef specializes in. It was unreal, especially considering I thought I was going to be having plain old bar food this evening. But this dish actually was insanely done well, who knew that I was actually looking for delicious food, and a great dining experience, when all I was expecting was your typical bar. Honestly, so glad to be in this neighborhood, and I have a feeling I already found my regular place. Keep that beer flowing!",

Our server was a sweet and pretty Asian woman who was all smiles (the genuine kind!).\n- Drink: Their wine selection is almost nonexistent so I tried the Coconut Porter beer by Maui ($7) as recommended by our server. It was REALLY GOOD!\n- Food:\n - Bacon Cheddar Tots ($7) - hot, crispy, delicious! This dish comes with the spicy sriracha ketchup which I've been trying to replicate at home because I loved it so much. haha :) Buuuuut I'm kind of pork intolerant so my stomach didn't love me so much after I scarfed this appetizer down by myself.\n - Colorado Lamb Burger ($15) - I'm not a big fan of lamb burgers but decided to try it anyway because our sweet server seemed really enthusiastic about it, and I realized I have never been a fan because I haven't had a good one until now! I was kind of full from the beer and tots so I took most of it home as well as the cold quinoa salad that came out as a side. It was still super delicious the next day when I used my toaster oven to heat it up for lunch. :D\n - Cioppino ($24) - Had a lot of mussels, clams, scallops, etc. It seemed fairly hearty but a bit salty for my taste... I'm not sure if I would order it again since it is a bit pricey as well.\n\nPS310 exceeded my expectations in both food quality and service. I hope they keep this up because I plan on returning over and over if they do. I can't wait to go back for Recess to try some more beer and sriracha ketchup! mmmmm spicy ketchup.... nom nom nom",

You get another star for having a good wine selection.  That's it though.  The menu looked so good, and when I came here for the first time for lunch I ordered the Adobo tacos with short ribs (I was informed they were out of them - which in looking at other reviews seems to happen at this place a lot).  Instead I had the steak salad which was meh.  I can't remember which item she ordered, but my friend was told they were out of what she wanted as well, so she settled on the Tuna tacos, which she said were yummy.  The server was attentive, but unfortunately, the kitchen took forever with our food.  It was a beautiful day and we wanted to sit outside, but we did not like the community style seating at the tables, so instead opted for a private booth inside.  Looking back, that was a wise decision, as the second time I came here was for happy hour, where apparently private seating is not an option.  I realize that this goes along with the theme of Public School, but when I arrived, half the place was empty, yet the hostesses informed me that in order to get happy hour prices, I'd have to squeeze into the middle of one of the long tables with rowdy college aged guys laughing and hooting and talking about the NCAA games.  Gross.  No thanks.  I left and went across the street for happy hour at The Culver Hotel which had a much classier atmosphere, plenty of space for privacy, and far less attitude.  I doubt I will be revisiting Publich School 310 again.",

                  "review": "Went here for the first time with my friend last night, and although we were bummed we missed \"recess\" (happy hour) thanks to the unnecessary traffic on Culver, we were still extremely happy with our experience! Yes we had to wait about 30-40 minutes for a table (arrived around 7) but we were able to grab some drinks at the bar and our table was ready before we knew it.  Great selection of beers on the rotating tap.\n\nMy friend is a vegetarian, so I was as well for the night, and if you are as well you will be happy with the large selection of vegetarian friendly dishes! We started with the wild mushroom taleggio levash (sp?) with truffle oil, DELICIOUS! We then moved onto trying the gigante beans and greens...basically huge beans and kale but man were they heavenly...I think we cleared that plate very quickly! Last we split the quinoa stuffed poblano pepper and again, delicious! I would highly recommend all of those, and the menu had so much more to offer, can't wait to go back!!!  \n\nOh also, if you are more of a wine drinker, get the bottle of E-1 Grenache blend...only $30 and our waiter said it was \"3 glasses\" but I don't know how big he thinks a glass is! I'd say it was closer to 5 normal glasses, and at $10 a glass the bottle is well worth it and a beautiful blend!\n\nAt the end our bill was just over $60, so we were pretty happy with that, and left content not stuffed after splitting a few plates.",

The tacos, tasty.  Quesadilla, for me just okay. Deviled eggs, satisfying.  $4-$6 each. Can't beat that!   Noisy inside (frown) but okay outside where we sat.  Communal tables may not be everyone's bag, though it is social and fun IMO. Server Evan (I think) was superb.  Checked in often though was not intrusive of a nuisance, in spite of the place being packed.  I'll go back.",

They beer selection is awesome and the 2 beers I ordered were delicious one was Sculpin By Ballast point and I'm blanking on the other.  We also ordered the Calamari and bacon tater tots.  The Calamari was really good.  The bacon tater tots were underwhelming, too greasy tasted like overfried tater tots, best part was the sriacha ketchup.  The food service and beer are good, but like a lot of the places in downtown Culver City, it is expensive.  I would go back for the beer selection alone, but not for any other reason.  Might try to go for dinner on like a special occasion.  If money is no object and you're an elitist hipster that likes to look down on people who aren't as \"cool\" as you are, then this is your place.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool",

We decided to finally check it out on a Sunday afternoon and were not disappointed!  Not only was it not crowded or busy but the staff were relaxed and very friendly.  The hostess was super funny and friendly.  We exchanged some funny observations of the restaurant crowd in Culver City.  The food did not disappoint.  I thought it was going to be the usual bar food fare but was surprised by the excellent choices.  My husband had the Kale Caesar salad with grilled salmon and I ordered the CCB,:a chicken cobb burger with a side of quinoa salad.  My only suggestion is that the quinoa salad have more fresh veggies and not mostly quinoa.  I think I only got a few small pieces of cucumber.",

The people I went with worked nearby so knew the menu. They made good suggestions. The food was delicious. Took a long time for lunch on a Thursday. But if wasn't an experience were half the folks got their food and the other half were waiting or some was cold, etc. It all came out together and at the right temperature. If the service was better I would rate it higher.",

It took over an hour to get our food and by the time we did get the food my friends girlfriend didnt get her plate until we were finished. The food was alright, not the best. The server was rude and to my girlfriend. The \"bottomless\" mimosas were not bottomless as we were given a limit to three carafes which were the size of one or maybe half a pint. Overpriced and not worth the wait, if you want to be a hipster and spend your money idiotically this is your place",

I went with the stuffed poblano and the mezze plattter (Exceptional). The stuffed poblano was pretty lovely, though by the end my mouth was on FIRE (and I'm Korean so I can take the heat).  I had two beers - the telegraph stout porter and the coconut porter (amazing) - even learned a thing or two about the proper pour for each beer). Maybe a little gimmicky but I didn't mind the extra attention. Christian waited on us and I felt pampered the whole time.",

It's a great casual place to grab a beer and tasty food.\n\nWe had a reservation at 9pm on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed. Our waiter/teacher, Christopher, was awesome. He was very knowledgeable on all the food and beers. On top of that he was really friendly and attentive. He noticed when certain items hadn't arrived and would keep us posted on it. Even though the place was crazy and busy, he still managed to keep his cool and check up on us regularly. He really seemed to care about working hard and treating customers well. At the end of our meal he thanked us for being so understanding with all the hiccups. He even treated us to their delicious, warm, gooey peanut better jelly cookies - fresh from the oven and served with a glass of milk!\n\nThe drinks were wonderful here. They had a wide variety of beers. The cocktails we sampled (cucumber mule, red smoke, juice box) were all well mixed and balanced and refreshing.\n\nThe food was well executed. The gigante beans and greens were flavorful. My friends ordered bacon-cheddar tots. I don't eat bacon, but they said it was amazing. They certainly looked and smelled that way. The poblano chile was a great option for a vegetarian. I loved the sauce and everything was cooked properly. My friend enjoyed her short rib on mashed potatoes. This dish is huge...  Apparently it's 1/2 lb of meat and 1/2 lb of potatoes. This is a serious dish. I think it's safe to say that the portions are generous.\n\nI'm looking forward to frequenting this restaurant. I had a great experience here, but I'm sure I'll love it even more once they work out all kinks that come with opening a new restaurant.",

We tried the CCB and Adobo Taco's with a Calamari appetizer. Calamari was very nice (spicy) I would recommend it for 4 people. CCB was delicious as were my taco's which I could not finish. Great place to go with some friends for a fun time.",

                  "review": "I have to refute the last review. I was actually right in front of the pair (previous reviewer) at the bar when the aforementioned transpired. The bartender with the (gorgeous) long, black, curly hair is in my humble opinion, is not only hands down the best bartender at Public School, but probably one of the best in culver city as a whole. I know because I frequent many (basically all) of the local spots regularly, I do my research.  By the way, I always get great service, because I know how to act. Maybe send your man round my way one of these days and I can school him on the proper way to order a drink from a crowded bar. I guarantee you he gets better service and enhances your overall experience. It's real easy to feel you've been mistreated and write a shitty review to get some reciprocity (oh, I'll show her) - but you get on the other side of that slammed and understaffed bar (no bar backs btw) and combine that with overpriced, over complicated cocktails, and a clientele which I'm sure you'll agree is not the most humble in the country, then you've got one hell of a difficult job. Handling it with grace and a smile, not just deep knowledge of the product, as well as bringing personality and charm to an otherwise stale corporate environment, is no easy task.  It's the staff at Public School that makes it what it is.  The good folks over there like Colin, Miryam, Bridgette, Dario, Jeff, Mike and Kingsley.  I could go on.  I don't think it's fair to slander anyone who's working really hard to take care of a customer base that can often be largely unappreciative.  I also believe that when you are appreciative, as a customer, you will receive excellent service because gratitude is a two way street.  Actually, now the more I think about it, the thirstier and hungrier I get.  I think I'll go by now at get a Citra Pale Ale and maybe a lamb burger.  The hunstman is also really good.  I would avoid the salmon pastrami, it's kind of a confused little dish.  Kale Caeser w Salmon if you're trying to do the healthy thing.  Get your beer on all day, it's supposed to be a gastropub.  But ordering one of their specialty cocktails when there's only one bartender on a holiday weekend - it's just bad form.  That's ok, you get a pass.  Everyone makes mistakes.  But ask any bartender how much they like making a mojito when the bar is slammed.  That's a drink that you get when there's no one there and they can put some love and effort into it for yo entitled ass! Namaste.",

The tots are solid, and the short ribs were great tonight.\n\nWith that said, the steak and chimichurri sauce is not as good as advertised. I'm pretty sure it was the chef tonight, but the waiter tried to back up the chef by claiming a chimichurri sauce is \"red based.\" Hmmm...everywhere else I've ordered it, and when I made it as a chef, it is green and not full of orange grease. The only thing red are pepper flakes, but parsley, cilantro, garlic, etc are not red. I was shocked to hear the waiters take, but decided to give them a pass and not talk with management. Probably the worst dish I've had in quite a while, though. The steak itself was well cooked and seasoned. It was this stale, nasty, old looking sauce they topped it with that ruined the dish.\n\nAll I can say is...while it does have some good dishes, the staff seems aloof and my entree was not good. Even after bringing it to my servers attention, my complaint was not followed up on properly.\n\nI'll chalk it up to a bad night, but it really left me with a bad taste. I'd go again, but probably for apps and drinks. Not dinner if that's how they roll.",

                  "review": "Updated review\nPS got in touch with me (with incredible swiftness, I might add.) I spoke to one of the operations managers about my last 2 times here. I was offered - and accepted - a $50 card to re-try the restaurant. But, as I told them (and they did encourage this), I am going to be honest. The card in no way affects my update. I did not inform anyone when I was going to go either.\n\nSince I'd gone for lunch & HH - I decided to give dinner a go and took my husband for a 2nd opinion. Now, perhaps PS is one of those restaurants that actually works more smoothly when busy because dinner was a much different, MUCH better experience.\n\nHosts were friendlier than prior times, and efficient. We were given a wait-time of 20-30 mins and called well within that quote. Text-call was cute.\n\nOur table was greeted in good time by our server, who, as fate would have it, was the same lady who waited on me previously. Before, she was sweet-but-a-bit-clueless. This time however, she had so much more CONFIDENCE! You can't train someone to be nice but it seems now that this particular server has some time under her belt, she's much more comfy making beer rec's and I would request her should I return. She brought a 'taster' & when I didn't like that particular beer, she happily made a couple more suggestions. Both my hubby & myself enjoyed the beers we got, both on her rec. HUGE improvement on menu knowledge & service.\n\nWe ordered the Bacon Tots to start and while I think they're a little expensive for what you get - They are tasty. Spacing was good between courses and all food arrived at the proper temperature.\n\nI had the Fish and Chips and hubby had the Lamb Burger (Fairly Priced. Good Value.) Fries were the best I've had at PS so far (I had fries both other times) Fish was well-battered & cooked. Little bit greasy but fish and chips are meant to be a little greasy (it ain't health food!), so that's not a complaint. Lamb Burger was very good, no change there. Portions were a good size and when I wanted to take my left-overs home, the server packaged them up beautifully & included the sauces (bonus points to her for doing that.)\n\nDessert was the Ice Cream Sandwich (Chef's Special) which was 'punch your grandma' delish, quite honestly.\n\nCheck came in good time but I didn't feel like I was being pushed out of the place (which can happen sometimes when a restaurant is busy.)\n\nFrankly, with all this, I was itching to give PS 4 stars and say \"Hooray for the Comeback Kid!!!!!!!!!\" but there's this one, but incredibly vital thing that's causing me to take one star away:\n\nThe Beer Pour/The Missing Beer By The Time The Glass Gets To The Table!!!!!!!!!!!! Once again, both myself & hubby's beers arrived with at least a finger-measure missing!!! PS is 3-for-3 on the not-full-beer-glass for me. I realize it was in the well, but to serve a beer like that is just ridiculous. The food/drink runner took them back and got them topped up (and was very pleasant about it) but - I really shouldn't have to ask for that and I'm not going to a place where I HAVE to ask for that every single time. Hubby ordered a 2nd beer & politely asked the server if she could make sure it was topped up. She brought it and proudly said, \"I made sure he filled it to the top!\" Are the servers scared of the bartenders or something? I've worked with a few 'bully-bartenders' before; SO up their own butts that they give wait-staff a hard time. Is this the reason? Or are bartenders encouraged to 'save beer'? I'm asking because I really don't understand it. Any 'tender worth their salt would be ashamed to send a beer out like that. One who feels comfortable doing that has no business behind a bar.\n\nAs it is - I would go to PS again for dinner, the food was very good and I have a feeling that the restaurant works better when busy (I get that, some places are similar. The times I went for lunch & HH, it was pretty empty) but NOT to have a few beers with some mates, as I would be embarrassed to bring friends somewhere where they'd have to ask for their glasses to be topped up. I would order a soda/water to go with my meal & have my beers/drinks somewhere else. I'm being picky about the beer measure/presentation with PS, this establishment prides itself on its artisan beers and how they're served ('An Education In Beer & Food' is a BIG claim.) If it's normal to have beers waiting in the well -  bartenders need to be conscientious - make sure they look freshly-poured & as full as possible when they do go out. It's something like that which makes me think I'm not getting money's worth. It's not just the value aspect - It's also the vibe of 'We don't care' and that irks me.\n\nAll in all, I would have given PS 4-stars this time, if not for the beer-pour problem. 3-stars it is. I sent a version of this update to management and they said they're unhappy with this issue, taking it seriously & are working to change it. When or if that's solved, I would like to return & bring friends.\nUseful 3\nFunny\nCool\n6/10/2013Previous review\nI really wanted to like this place - I did - and I gave it two chances. The first time was lunch, the Lamb Burger was actually very good & the server was sweet-in-a-sort-of-clueless-way BUT - I don't care if the beer you're serving is made from the tears of blind Tibetan monks; Serve a full glass, not one that looks like someone already took a few sips from it. Let the wine connoisseurs have their half-empty glasses; Beer (whatever kind of beer) is the beverage of the working man or woman. Don't short-pour. Nobody wants to be your friend if you short-pour.\n\n2nd shot for PS was at Happy Hour and while the food was OK, it's trying WAY too hard to be super-duper fancy, and therefore kind of loses the point - Parmesan Truffle 'Frites'  are a good idea but placing 3 or 4 slices of parm on top screams laziness. I'd like to taste the cheese WITH the fries, y'know? There was just too much going on with the tacos to let the real flavor come through. I could have been eating anything really (allegedly they were chicken & braised rib. Allegedly. This is a shame because I AM aware that they buy good quality meats. Why cover it up with a whole bunch of 'stuff'?)\n\nThe service is hit-and-miss - I don't expect to have flower-petals thrown at me when I walk into a place but I just got the vibe that they thought they were doing me a big favor by letting me eat at their establishment both times.\n\nThe thing that annoyed me the most though is that when I got my change back after paying my HH bill - They rounded UP which I thought was pretty cheeky - Not even a \"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm out of coins!\" I was only shorted, like, 30-something cents but that's not the point. Let ME decide if I'm going to leave the coins (which I probably would have, unless I got some quarters & laundry day was approaching.) I almost didn't leave a tip, because I felt like he'd already taken it but I work in the restaurant industry & for my own sake, I don't wanna be That Person.",

The scallops were very tender and flavorful but the brussels seemed undercooked and hard.  Also, I think the salad would have been even better if it were served warm instead of cold.  The space is very cool, sort of rustic modern.  I definitely want to come back and try some of the other dishes.  The lunch menu was surprisingly extensive.",

On more than one occasion, instead of the usual \"how's your food?\" check-in, a waitress has come over to my table and said something ridiculous about how envious she is of my food... small complaint but annoying and strange enough to bother me.",

                  "review": "Decided on having a nice dinner in downtown Culver City tonight and had the worst dining experience. First as we were waiting to put our name on the list another party approaching behind us was greeted first and asked how many in their party. So I told the semi rude hostess that we were there before them. Then we were sat 20 min later and 5min after our quote time. We orderd the tater tots app and it was very tasty. Then we ordered bangers n mash and bison burger with fries. We told our server that we would be OK if either one came out first. We didn't need them together. After waiting 20 or so mins for either entr\u00e9e the server informed us the kitchen had a \"hiccup\" with the computers and that it would be out soon. After another 10 min (30 min total) we finally got the bangers. At this point 15 min after we finished, a young gentleman with glasses came over to apologize. I can only assume he was a manager because he never introduced himself. He said the same \"hiccup\" story and said our bison burger cooked medium was almost out, \"maybe\" 5 min. At this point total wait time for two entr\u00e9es is reaching 50 mins. We finally canceled the burger because the table that sat 20min after we did had gotten their apps that they ordered, in 5mins. While waiting for the server to return with out credit card we were then offered a free calamari. Sorry a little too late. The manager did make some adjustments to the check but being that I have worked and managed restaurants for the last 15 years I felt it could have been handled much better.",

As homegrown westsider, its nearly blasphemy for me to get any of my friends to travel any length east of the 405, but thankfully PS cloned its downtown flagship and came to me in Culver City.  \n\nIt was day 2 of their official opening around 6ish, and oh lordy was it packed. The Happy Hour was calling to me, and even though I had to stand around the bar to wait eagerly for a seat, it was well worth it.  The environment alone, was a soothing mix of hipster plaid and hoity TV execs on an expensed business drink.  I consider myself a gastropub connoisseur and have considered it a part time job on its own (sadly not lucrative just yet), and PS's beer list was exactly on par with what I needed.  Not just their tap list, but their bottles were a fantastic range from Drakes 1500 to Hitachino.  Just a tip, the bar area also includes this cute nook to the left of the bar which is an enclosed patio.  \n\nThe staff was entirely too friendly and looking around, no one planned on leaving anytime soon.  Which is what you need if you just want to let the day unwind at a casual place like this.  No one likes feeling rushed out of their seat.  \n\nHH food was delish, and the boyfriend got the Street Dog which was massive for only $5.  The naked wings smelled fantastic even though we didn't order them, but likely we'll have to do that the next time around.  \n\nWhile I also like the feel of City Tavern, PS is cozy, less hectic, and their staff actually knows how to recommend beer to the novice, Stella only drinkers of the world.  I hate to rave about it at the risk of always having trouble finding space at the bar, but like I said, if you don't mind chatting and standing before space is available, you'll love it here.  All you really need is a drink in your hand anyway.",

It becomes a real scene a little later after normal dinner hours - more of a bar than restaurant which is cool.  It is a real gathering place, young hip and with a diverse and rotating beer and drink selection.  It is load with a great layout and various seating from small booths, to large sit-up picnic tables to patio seating so groups are perfect for this place.  The food was 'over-thought' and they tried to get too creative with old classics making them something they aren't.  They are obviously pushing the envelope with food combining and new additions and prep styles to dishes - guess that's the 'gastropub' part but it detracted from the meal.  Though this is obviously subjective, the food was heavy, over-seasoned and had too many conflicting flavors combined.  We got the Poke, mac and cheese and the shrimp and grits. Very heavy 'gut-bomb'.  But that may just be our taste and could be perfect for others.  It was also a bit overpriced for both food and drink for what you got but hey, it is the location and the crowd you go there for and that alone is worth it.  I'll be back for the beer and hanging on the sidewalk patin - a perfect place to meet and hang-out but eat dinner elsewhere.",

It could've been that the music was blaring behind her and I just saw her lips move and that's my other negative. Unless you can read lips really well, you'll have to ask her to repeat herself several times, which apparently is annoying to her. She'll take your cell # because that's how they let you know your table is available - via text.\n\nWe were quoted 30 mins for our table at 8:10pm on a Saturday night. It was only 20 mins but because they text you when your table becomes available, we were able to check out the new spot across the street and come back in plenty of time.\n\nThe cocktails: Refreshing. I had some vodka and ginger beer drink with a touch of cucumber. It was recommended to me by the waiter, who offered to take it back if I wasn't pleased with it. It was delicious! I was on an antibiotic and working against what my doctor advised about staying away from alcohol. Of course, I didn't listen but I'm glad because this was a really good drink and I didn't die.\n\nThe food: Delicious. We started out with the bacon/cheddar tots. Really tasty. A little on the greasy side but what do you expect with bacon, cheese and fried potato?? My entree was the shrimp and chorizo campanelle (looks like bow-tie pasta) in a cream sauce. DELISH! The shrimp was slightly overcooked and a bit tough but the flavor combo in the rest of the dish more than made up for it.\n\nThe service: This is where I was really impressed. I had a bad taste from the wannabe hipster chick at the hostess stand but our waiter and everyone else involved in bringing our drinks, appetizer and entrees were exceptional. There was a flub up with our appetizer. It came, quite literally, 30 seconds before our entree. The woman who brought out our entree asked if we had a problem with our appetizer since we hadn't touched it. I said we didn't have time; it had just come out. She apologized and what transpired after that really wow'd me. The waiter came to our table and apologized profusely for having our appetizer delayed. He said he would ask his manager to comp it for us because it was unacceptable. His manager did come over to the table and apologized further and assured us the app would be comp'd. I've been to places where I order an app and it comes WITH the meal and no one bats an eyelash. NOT here. They take their service seriously and that's refreshing and appreciated.\n\nOverall, I would return without hesitation. The music is loud but their cocktails, food and attentive staff make you forget about it.",

I have to say Tuscan chopped salad was the best chopped salad I've had by far. It was well balanced. Salty, crunchy and tangy. I would come back here for the salad. I really enjoyed the meal",

                  "review": "Let me start off by saying I use Yelp frequently to find out info about places, but I never write reviews.  Until now.  \n\nBeing from Denver originally and currently residing in Los Angeles, I can say that I've never read more douchey reviews from ANYWHERE else.  And I've lived a lot of places. The biggest problem I've noticed is everyone who lives in LA thinks that they are a brilliant foodie with a trained palate and that the world wants to hear their uninformed, entitled opinion about their one sided experience.  Hey douchey mcdouchersons, if your snarky reviews make you feel better in your world then I truly wonder how amazing your existence really is.  \n\nIn this post I will give the reader a real version of what's going down at Public School 310, formally Fraiche, and I will also address some of the moronic negative reviews.  \n\nFirst of all the inside d\u00e9cor is awesome. Open kitchen line, communal tables, wrought iron and deep colored wood tables with plush, cozy booths, heated outdoor patio, and TVs!  Microscopes, encyclopedias, multiplication tables, alphabet board and a wall made to look like pushed in bleachers will take you back to junior high school for sure.  I've been here twice already, once with my girl and once with my buddies (good for everyone).  Both parties were impressed by the new setup.  Staff was smiling, knowledgeable and friendly and the food was great.  I've seen the cutting board, huntsman burger, bacon cheddar tots, stout braised short ribs, happy hour pb&j sliders, happy hour nachos; Tuscan chopped salad and the chocolate stout brownie.  All were delicious.  \n\nIs the food the greatest food I've ever had? Will the chef compete on the next top chef masters? The answer to that is probably not but I gauge things these days on whether or not the food was palatable and worth my time and hard earned money.  The answer to both of those questions is a resounding YES! I will be back for sure and I don't even live in the neighborhood! 24 beers on draft and 12 or so in the bottle, and I know good beer, pretty impressive list.  The house cocktails look interesting too and my girl liked the red smoke and my buddy liked their version of a whiskey negroni (the name escapes me).\n\nAs far as the things that have been written negatively so far, Ill address them one by one.\n-Hey reviewer that complained about no take out food yet.  Really? Really? Give me a break, they will figure it out soon I'm sure.\n-Hey guy who thinks its too bright inside. Really? Really? What are you an interior designer? People on yelp want to know about the food and service not the stupid lighting. \"'Culver Hotel, Ugo, Fords, Akasha, Rush figured it out. You need to too.'\"\n\"Hey buddy, see you over at Rush.\" -Said no one ever.\n-Attention man who stayed on hold for ten minutes. I have an idea; DON'T STAY ON HOLD FOR TEN MINUTES. Hang up and call back, they're the new restaurant in town, its gonna be packed, there are almost 4 million people in LA, what did you expect?\n- Cafeteria girl.  We got the cheese/meat plate and there were 3 cheeses and like 10 other things on the board and it was great. Maybe the reason you had one cheese at happy hour is because it costs $5. Duh.\n- And finally I've saved the best for last.  The most recent negative review comes to us from a yelp \"Elite\" moron who decides to use the real name (presumably) of a confused hostess on a busy night.  So sorry they couldn't bow down to serve you properly your majesty.  I'm sure at your job you never get busy or overwhelmed and are always able to perform your tasks at full capacity.  Hopefully next time when you arrive on your horse drawn carriage they will recognize who you are and immediately clear a table for your dining pleasure.  \nYou should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nMy apologies for the long review and opinion, I just couldn't take the douchey attitude that goes with this sort of thing anymore.  Perhaps all the negative reviewers will get together in their Ed Hardy and Affliction t-shirts and discuss my attitude problem. I like to think they would waste their time thinking about me.  It just makes this review that much more pleasant.\n\nOverall, Public School 310 has been a good dining experience for my friends and I twice. Booze, food, service, ambiance and newness are all a plus in my book. Sure they have some kinks to work out, but what week old restaurant doesn't.  Go check it out, you wont be disappointed.",

I ordered the salmon pastrami.. at first i thought it was pastrami meat and salmon meat on one single sandwich which wouldve been awesome.. but it was just salmon that was smoked/cured in their own way.. luckily I love salmon alone so I enjoyed it.. their appetizers were more notable than the sandwich though.. the lamb burger is probably one of the best things off the menu ... If their dessert special sounds good it's worth trying.. We got a PB&J cookie.. which sounds plain but it was quite tasty.",

                  "review": "My wife and I went here for dinner on a Wednesday night.  Initially the wait was 30 minutes, but we were seated within 10.  The place is fun, with a lively atmosphere and details nodding to the restaurant's name and theme.  Either there was a more raucous crowd than usual or sound is carried far in this space, but it was so loud that we were often leaning in saying \"what?\" and repeating our comments frequently.  There's a nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles.  We started with the bacon and cheese tater tots, which were tasty and a unique idea, but ultimately too greasy.  The house sriracha ketchup was pretty darn good though.  Usually we are wary of housemade ketchups b/c they often taste worse than the store bought stuff.  Then came a tasty and light wild mushroom & teleggio lavash, which was a like a flat bread pizza with fragrant truffle oil.  For our main course I had the short ribs, which were decent, but my wife's fish and chips were a disaster.  To start off, the fish were served on a bed of cold fries (in their defense they were crispy and well seasoned).  The batter was a thick, dense cocoon that was heavy and lacked crispiness.  Dessert was peanut butter and jelly cookies that my wife enjoyed, but I thought were just ok--basically peanut butter cookies with a dollop of strawberry jam in the middle.  I especially enjoyed the glass of whole milk that accompanied the cookies since my wife always makes me drink non-fat.  Maybe it was an off night, but for $43 a person, I can think of a number of other nearby places that serve better food.",

I also have the most horrible memory--probably from drinking too much wine--so I have to ask the staff everywhere I go what wine to get, even if I've been there 20 times. Good news for all you wine drinkers: I think I remember what wine I had, and it was yummy! It was the Grenache Blend... um, I think.  But it was delish!  So was the food. We went on a Monday night for dinner after getting off a plane, starving and tired. Like other reviewers, we waited until it was less crowded to try it. I did not know what to order, there were so many things on the menu I wanted. I ended up ordering the Huntsmen burger with no bun with the quinoa salad. If you've read my reviews, you will know that ordering a burger low carb style (sans bun) really lets you see a burger in all it's glory. The burger must stand on its own. It was excellent and cooked exactly how I wanted it.  The service was good, too. Not amazing, but not bad either. Yes, as others have said, the music was good, too. It's the only place in the CC where you will be singing along to the Broken Bells.  I am looking forward to trying this place during \"recess.\" i have a feeling recess is coming soon....",

I had the Thia Chicken Noodle Salad, Fiery Calamari, Gigante Beans and Greens, Broccoli and the Wild Mushroom Lavash.  The salad tasted like something youd get at the Whole Foods service counter, the Calamari had almost no flavor at all and were anything but \"fiery\", the beans and greens had pretty good flavor and were probably the best non-dessert item that I had, the broccoli was basically just broccoli, and the lavash was a cracker with way too much truffle oil and some mushrooms on it.  The buildout is okay but I think Fraiche had done a more classy job with the space.  Overall, the place is okay so its getting 3 stars.  I probably wont be back anytime soon, unless its for a beer.",

I wasn't impressed when I saw how limited their food menu was, but everything on it we tried was beyond delicious.   The calamari was seasoned to perfection and they had the best steak I've ever had in my life. Can't wait to come back so I can try more on their menu :)",

This place jsut opened up recently in Culver.The decor was very cool and there was interesting little things to look everywhere. The menus looked like the old black and white composition notebooks and the napkins designed like small squares of notebook paper. You can tell that someone put some serious thought into all the decor right down to the utensils and glasses. Everything looked unique. The background indie style music was at a decent level.The prices were fair. I got the all american burger with cheese. It was VERY good. The side of fries were awful though. They were overcooked, crunchy and cold. This is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. They dont have ranch there so i got a side of the lemon ranch style dipping sauce. It was really good! My coworkers seemed to like their food too. One complaint was that they did not have any acutal salsa to serve with the tacos only hot sauce. All in all it was a good experience and i will go back. The waitresss was friendly and attentive too. Ecspeically since they offer over 40 diff types of beer. I will just get the side salad next time with my burger!",

On the other side of the awesome spectrum are the Cheddar and Bacon Tater Tots. I want to swim in them like Scrooge Mac Duck swims in gold. The burgers (including the lamb burger) are juicy and delicious. The beer selection is great- try the cocktails, too!",

I had a salmon Rubin and a kale Caesar (I know, very LA douchey sounding but it was a very good salad.)  Our server turned suggested that we try the BACON CHEDDAR TATOR TOTS.  They were fan-freakin'-tastic!  She also recommended these cauliflower mac n' cheese like things with spec.  Those were great too!\nSecond, their beer list isn't bad at all.  I am a sucker for a quality IPA and they've got some good ones!  If you are not into hoppy beer, I totally understand.  Our server also got us into this very tasty brown ale.\nThird, the wait staff was great.  Our server was cool as hell.  I think her name was Paige (tall, cute, blonde.)  She had no attitude what so ever.  She had great recommendations but didn't force anything on us.  Frankly, it felt like she was part of the group.  Someone else assisted us, Lloyd or Floyd, when our server went on break.  He was cool too!!!\n\nIf you're looking for a chill, fun time having some good food with some great beer, check this spot out.  Check out the patio.  You'll be right on Culver Blvd. enjoying downtown Culver City.",

The place looks great...lots of olde timey school details.  We were seated immediately and were really excited about the food as we checked out the menus.  It was bustling, sorta, but not full...no where near BUSY.  We sat and looked around and admired the decor for a bit...then \"a bit\" turned into \"a while\".  Finally a waitress wandered by and said she'd be with us in a minute.  When she returned she was friendly and totally unaware that we'd been there for so long so we let it go and figured all would be well now.  16 minutes later another server brought us our drinks.  We probably would have walked out except my husband injured his back recently and walking is very painful.  A few minutes later our bacon cheddar tots arrived...and they were spectacular enough to sooth the savage beast!  They were quite greasy though...in a good way...and no one had brought us any place settings.  We asked a runner for some and he immediately obliged.  When we had finished our apps and most of our drinks our waitress returned to take our order.  She left without taking the empty dish or asking if we'd like another beverage.  When main courses arrived...via another server once again...my husband's glass had been empty for some time and I had about a quarter inch of liquid left...nobody inquired about that.  Then our waitress returned again and took the empty app dish and brought more silverware, even though we were already eating...with silverware.  She didn't remove our empty glasses or ask if we'd like another...we had already decided to finish our food and get another drink elsewhere, but she didn't know that. My husband got the salmon pastrami ruben and I got the quinoa stuffed poblano...both were excellent!  We are both people who really care WAY more about the food and the ambiance than the service, but this was almost comically, shockingly bad service!  We were in the restaurant for an hour and 40 mins and 90% of that time was spent waiting...not eating or drinking!  We left and went back to the parking lot to discover that although the sign on the way in says 1st 2 hours free, there was another sign near where we'd parked on the 1st floor that said 1 hour parking...we hadn't noticed that...and we had a $60 ticket as the cherry on the cake of our ridiculous brunch experience.  Aaaaargh!",

But as customers in the patio start to leave they immediately begin \"closing down\" that area by taking the chairs and stacking them together.  So we're they only ones in the outside patio, surrounded by completely cleared tables and stacked chairs.  It gave us all the feeling that it was time for us to go.  There were plenty of people inside still, so it's not like it was the end of the night.  We may have stayed longer if the environment was more welcoming.  If you go, have the Cucumber Mule.  It's delicious.  I didn't try the food, so I can't comment.",

She is in her 80\"s and i thought it would be nice to let her check out at place i have been a few times. Our server came by right when we sat down (and i mean RIGHT when we sat down) asked us what we wanted to drink. We didnt even have a chance to open the menu.. My mother brings her own water everywhere she goes bc she thinks ( god knows what she thinks) but thats what she does. and at that age i guess they can do what they want. So we asked really quick for three glasses , one empty (for her water)  now talk about giving dirty looks! i felt the need to explain that she tries to drink clean. haha whatever that means. Anyways, he left and didnt come back for 15 min and he did walk by had to yell excuse me. We ordered some beers and some apps.. first beer we ask for the white ale , he said they were out. hmmmmm.. okay i get it.. ended up with some hefs. moving on.. he brought the beers then asked if we wanted to order anymore apps. at that point i said, we already ordered them, remember?! he looked at me like ya i know, do you want more? his whole deal was what a Shit*y attitude.. then my mother ordered fish and chips and ask him what type of fries were they? small and crispy? steak fries? and this is where he even got RUDER.. he said they are FRIES! i at that point had to lean over to him and say, HEY! she is an older lady be nice! I WANTED TO SAY, do you talk to your mom like that?! but i just let it go.. just kinda sucked paying close to $100.00 to be treated like. needless to say, i wont be going back anytime soon and if someone asks what i think, ill say id pass..",

We had the brick chicken which was flavorful, with the bean stew. The Huntsmen burger was an interesting combination although we ordered it Medium well and it came Medium rare. My friends like the tacos. I liked the Lemon Meringue dessert. Service was okay. They were slammed busy. My biggest complaint is the sound. Why does the music have to be SO loud? Everyone is yelling trying to have a conversation over the music. I couldn't wait to get out there. Although, there are some other menu items I would like to try, I don't think I would go back for the noise.",

My husband and I went for happy hour but since there was no room in the happy hour area we decided to have dinner in the restaurant.   We were seated and then ignored by several staff members.  Other tables were served as wait persons passed us by time and again.  We finally had to flag someone down to take our order.  The food arrived in a timely manner.  My husband thought his short ribs were good but the fish and chips were not good.  The fish batter was soggy instead of crispy as it should have been.  At $15, definitely not worth it.  The food being served for those folks who managed to snag a happy hour table looked great, but the normal menu needs to be kept after class.",

I want to start by giving big props to our waitress Nikole, she did a very good job and immediately my wife and I commented that she really gave quality service and was a good way to start our first time at this establishment.  The beer list is great I had a The Dragoons Irish Stout and the wife had strawberry beer that she really enjoyed.  She had the B.C.C. (chicken burger) with quinoa and I had the huntsman with fries.  The BCC was exactly what I always hope for when ordering a chicken sandwich (usually I am quite disappointed) It was perfectly cooked.  The Huntsman was a tasty burger, cooked to order and the cheese was strong and delicious.  The highlight for me were the fries, fries are usually an afterthought and not much to right home about, but these were simple yet amazing... Kudos to the chef!  We will definitely be back!",

However, a good experience it was not.  The menu was fun, the food was quite delicious, and the beer list looked great (though we opted to share a bottle of wine instead).  The patio was also a great seating area with a terrific view of the Culver Hotel across the street.  But the service was atrocious -- I mean, some of the WORST service I've ever had.  The waiter paid us only a few visits over the course of nearly 2 hours, with 20 minutes or more in between.  He was friendly enough, but otherwise completely out to lunch.  Long waits for his initial visit, for our wine to arrive, and for any service thereafter.  When we asked the hostess (we were seated next to her station) for help in tracking down our wine, she offered a lame excuse about the bar being backed up.  We were very surprised that -- despite the waiter's apparent recognition that we felt very neglected -- no one came around to talk to us, offer us a dessert, or any other common restitution.

On the whole it was pretty good.  I'm giving it 4 stars, but based on my first visit it may really be 3.5.  The vibe is nice and it's a good looking place, BUT, if you want to scope people out from your booth it's basically impossible because they've built the dividers too high.  They really dropped the ball there, because the layout of the place is otherwise well suited for eye catching.  In terms of food: I had the salmon kale Caesar.  It was fine.  Good chunk of fish, but the salad was just kale and romaine...that's it. I was hoping for a little more flair.  Husband said his burger was fantastic though, so they've got that going for them.

                  "review": "Updated review\ni came back and the folks here took care of me and i had the short rib with mash potatoes. the food was piping hot and the short rib was very tender. the onions were good too and the mash potatoes were quite tasty. i met christopher as well and he was friendly. other staff people that weren't serving my table were also very friendly and made small talk. the place is crowded and i think possibly i just had an off night closer to when they opened. it's expected as a new place works out the kinks. Looks like my winter break is over and i maybe going back to public school again. thanks guys.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n1/7/2013Previous review\nupdate: after writing the review two people from this organization contacted me and apologized for the food being off that night. one of the people even reached out and offered to speak via phone. i was very impressed by their professionalism. they encouraged me to come back and try them again. that was very nice. i will give them another try.\nRead more\n12/27/2012Previous review\nhere's my honest review on this place.\n\natmosphere:\npros: neat concept, the whole \"school\" thing. It's decorated with different school elements and even the menu comes on what looks to be notebook paper. long tables are in the bar area where you sit with other strangers (like the first day of school) and eat. Its creates an environment that is somewhat friendly and easy to small talk and meet new people.\n\ncons: seems pretty small in terms of the seating inside. also, it gets really loud inside for some reason so it's hard to hear yourself talk. you literally have to yell to hear someone else. wouldn't recommend this for a date place as it's just too loud in the bar/'recess\" area.\n\nstaff: front door star were nice and friendly. waitress was \"ok\". didn't really get a genuine nice feeling from her but she smiled and was helpful but it certainly felt more like she was doing her job and reading from a script versus genuinely being friendly. but i am not complaining she could have been worse.\n\nfood: this review was on the \"recess\" happy hr items I tasted:\ntacos: came out cold and I had to send them back. When they came back they were warm. They were good. I think two were $5 or $7 can't remember.\n\nburgers: I asked if they were well done as i do not like pink in the middle burgers. Waitress assured they were since they were very small. Of course, they were pink in the middle. They were very tasty though. I ate around the edges and just dealt with it. I didn't feel like sending more food back.\n\nTruffle fries: instead of long fries, you actually seem to get these cut up fry chips. Imagine a regular french fry and imagine someone cutting it into three smaller pieces. That's the size of the fries here. So since they are so small they actually seem to cook faster so you are left with a lot of crunchy \"chips\" than a full on fry. They came out warm but not piping hot so you had better eat them fast.\n\nOverall. Based on the bar bites, I would not rush here again to try anything else. I do not enjoy throwing money away at mediocre food. I'm sure the other options are good but come on guys, food should be hot and not luke warm or cold. if you can't get that right, I dont want to spend more money on fancy high priced cold entrees.",

I've been coming here for about 12 years and it's my favorite hangout in Los Angeles. It's a dive bar in the best way possible. Cheap GOOD drinks, great bar food (grilled cheese supreme FTW!) and the best staff you can ask for!\n\nI've always been a regular here but since they reopened after the pandemic closure I've been coming mostly every karaoke night (Thurs-Sat). It's my \"Cheers\" bar and honestly the one place that brings me joy these days. I have turned so many friends on to this place and the feeling is always mutual!\n\nKJ Shane (karaoke DJ) is so good at what he does. I really respect him and how he implements rules so that karaoke is fair and fun. The karaoke selection is great! I love the new app and how many more songs they have available.\n\nThe waitresses and security are great, especially Blaize and Shaun. They make me feel at home and I'm always taken care of.\n\nThe best part is that you can reserve your party for free and they even give you party shots. I've had my birthday here every year for at least the last decade and Backstage does not disappoint.\n\nAnd of course a huge shout out to the owner Ben for keeping this bar the gem that it is!\nSee all photos from Sarah M. for Backstage Bar & Grill\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\n2/28/2016Previous review\nI absolutely love the Backstage Bar! I call it my \"Cheers\" bar... where everybody knows my name, and they're always glad I came, lol.\n\nThe Backstage Bar is my go to place if I'm going out to have a drink and have a good night. I've been coming here for years, after a friend recommended this place for my birthday. I was hooked from that moment on! The karaoke is so much fun! They have a great variety of songs. The KJ's Shane and Ronnie are literally the best!\n\nThe drinks are cheap and delicious. The bartender Steve rocks! (He's also a great singer.) Their food is also literally the best bar food, hands down. The macaroni and cheese is to die for. The grilled cheese supreme is like heaven in my mouth. And who could forget the garlic fries? Yum!\n\nI'd love to keep this gem to myself but I find it hard not to shout it from the rooftops... I love the Backstage Bar!\nRead more\n8/3/2011Previous review\nCame here for my last birthday after my friend recommended it. This place is awesome. Cheap drinks, karaoke, good bar food and a photo booth. What more can you ask for? I reserved a table for free and even got a free drink from the waitress for my birthday. Had a blast. They let me bring my own cake too.",

Street parking is available, however a lot of the spots are metered/permit so you might be walking a little.\n\nPlacing your name on the list you have to scan the QR code and select your song. Also, bring that this was my first time here, when ordering food/drinks you have to give them your credit card first to hold and then place your order (yup... odd right?) when paying cash, you place your drink order but the bartender requests payment first prior to making drinks ... again (loln inside).\n\nVac card required",

Greasy sliders, crispy jalape\u00f1o poppers, delicious chicken tenders, etc. This place isn't for gourmet night, this is where you come to pound beer and devour finger foods that you will regret tomorrow morning.\n\nThe bartenders are always really nice even though you have to fight for their attention to order sometimes. The bouncers kinda sit there and grumpily ignore you. Someone might spill a beer on the counter screaming at a sports game while you're there. These all add stars to my rating in a lousy sports bar!\n\nIf you are not a Seattle Seahawks fan I recommend not coming here during a game as it gets crowded. I also can't hold a tune if my life depended on it so karaoke nights are a no for me, but I still dig this place.\n\nIf you like bars that lack some shine, this is a solid spot to visit.",

It's rare to see someone that has done their job as long as Shane be so enthusiastic and authentic. Shane is the best. The  sound system is perfect. It's really a great experience.

Our server was Hannah and she was wonderful. She was speedy, friendly, and so attentive. They were communicative about our reservations too (thank you Ben!).

It's a long wait, but it's worth it to dance, have fun, and see the talented singers.  \nI also started going to Backstage on the weekdays with their awesome weekly specials.  \nI'm not sure if they do it anymore, but the $5 for delicious burger and fries on Mondays were AWESOME.  Coupled that with Happy Hour and getting food/drinks for around $10 was such a good deal.\n\nI've also been to a few of their Sunday trivia nights and won a couple of times which is pretty fun.\n\nI hope things get back to normal eventually, so I can have the option of going out and having fun with friends.",

All of them are working inside and outside to make sure things are peaceful and fun! I am only giving 4 stars however because this last weekend I noticed there was a bit of chaos in the bar and I think honestly its because there just wasn't as many of the security guys working. They are needed and appreciated!!! The bar itself is fantastic and all the employees are great. we love karaoke!",

I think not, the crowds speak for themselves!\n\nThere are so many reasons as to why this is one of the best bars in the area.\n1. They actually have a good kitchen that's open until 12AM. Their garlic fries are great, enjoy them with chicken tenders. I've also enjoyed their mac & cheese, everything is pretty great there\n\n2. They have a decent assortment of beer, they offer both craft and bar staple varieties\n\n3. They have a WELL stocked bar, this is bare minimum I guess, if you call yourself a bar!\n\n4. The endless karaoke, but my favorite, their Sunday night 8PM trivia\n\n5. Finally, last bot not least, the people who work at Backstage are actually good and nice. They make the ambiance way more fun, and the overall experience stellar.\n\nDon't sleep on Backstage, its a pretty fantastic bar.",

This is \"nacho\" average bar!\n\nFood: (first) Nachos with Steak, (second) Spicy Ranch Grilled Chicken Sandwich, (third) House Mac and Cheese, (fourth) Skirt Steak Salad, (fifth) House Burger-1/2 pound, (sixth) Carne Asada Tacos\n\nPrice: $9, $9, $6, $9, $9\n\nRatings: wow, never had bar food this good AND this cheap! The bar food was actually really good too for its price. Items were all pretty big and made really well. I definitely recommend getting their nachos with beef, MAC AND CHEESE, and their carne asada tacos. Their nachos were super crispy and and very flavorful. The mac and cheese was so creamy and rich, but it didn't taste too salty, which I liked. And the carne asada tacos were pretty juicy and filled. They also have a large amount of drink options and happy hour prices. Service was amazing. It's just a little dark in there! But overall, I LOVED the experience. Definitely coming back again!\nSee all photos from Ashley S. for Backstage Bar & Grill",

The lay out is really cool. Location is perfect for locals and anyone hanging in the area. The karaoke DJ's were great as well. Over all I have no real complaints. I now live in the area so you can bet your ass I'll be back. And sure, I'll give the buffalo wings another try.\nNothing like karaoke to end a fun date night.",

Mac and cheese, chicken tenders, nachos, burgers are bar staples for really good prices. Sure it isn't gourmet food but set expectations accordingly since this is a dive karaoke bar. Servers are a bit slow so I always order at the bar but that's just me.\nThey do a great job with hosting large groups and are always responsive. There is rarely a line to get in even on weekends although the bar is usually super crowded after 10pm. Parking is available on culver blvd right across.\nThis is a super fun time so highly recommend trying one of their karaoke nights.\ncalm before the karaoke storm, bar area",

                  "review": "I wish someone wrote this review before me so I would have thought twice about hosting a company event here. But please do keep in mind that if you're just going there for some drinks with friends or celebrating a birthday with a small group it's probably fine.\n\nI booked our company's event with the manager, Ben, a couple of weeks in advance and firmed up all details the week before. The day before I reached out once more just to re-confirm. Ben then called me 3 times the day-of to go over the details again and it seemed he had different ideas than what we had already agreed on, i.e. passed apps instead of the buffet table I asked for. But fine, no big deal. He told me who to ask for when I arrive since he wouldn't be there and confirmed that we are all set. Overall, he was easy to talk to so I was confident that our event would go off without a hitch.\n\nI arrive and ask the bartender for Sarah and am told that Sarah isn't on that night. I find that odd since I literally just spoke to Ben an hour ago but simply explain that I'm hosting a company event at the bar tonight. She's shocked because she knows nothing about it! She calls Ben, and finally gets the details...literally no more than 30 minutes before the event start time. Deduct a star.\n\nI then look around and notice that there are no \"reserved\" signs on any tables and people are occupying some of the tables in the front of the bar, yet I was promised by the manager that we would have the entire front end and the back of the room would be available to others. I should mention, private trivia just for our group was part of the deal and that's why we wanted a semi-private area for our guests. Our server ends up  rounding up a row of tables for us to occupy and asks a group to move over to another, apologizing to me that she literally just found out about the event. We were not able to occupy the entire front end of the room as promised. Deduct a star.\n\nOkay fine, at least we have enough tables to gather around. I ask for the wrist bands that Ben said we'd be using to identify who is on my tab...\n\"Wrist bands? What wrist bands? We don't have any.\" Deduct a star.\n\nChristoff ends up taking over our event with just 15 minutes to go and at least he has the correct menu that I had selected. The few bites I had were good, so I'll add a star for that. BUT, I have to ask for napkins and we're not given forks or any utensils to eat the smaller items with like cheesy brussels sprouts or cauliflower pieces, so everyone is using their hands to pop gooey items into their mouths and at this point I was too tired to keep asking for things. Deduct a star.\n\nI'll add another star because Tom, our trivia guy did a good job and even wrote a round of questions that pertained to our team names, which he received in advance, so that was cool. But as someone whose job it is to plan company events on a regular basis, I probably wouldn't host another event here. It was too stressful. With that said, our bill came out to approx. $1,500 for about 40 people so if you're on a budget, Backstage is an option to consider. The manager did assume responsibility and apologized and explained that this was an anomaly.\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool 2\nSam P.\nBusiness Customer Service",

Like, the food is so good that we've gone the last three days in a row, first for karaoke, then trivia, and then tonight just because we wanted to try their burgers.\n\nMy only gripe is that the lighting in the bar is pretty dim - sometimes you'll need to break out a flashlight to read the menu.

The place was pumping. The drinks were flowing and people were singing their heart out. This is definitely a karaoke bar, where everyone can come and have a great time. It just had a cool and positive vibe to this place.\n\nThe bar is to the right of the restaurant.  In the center of the room, there is the DJ and a small dance area, where people are performing. There are tables surround the dance area, this make you part of the fun. some of these performers will come around to your table to engage you.\n\nFood and drinks are cheap. I heard the happy hour is amazing.\n\nOverall, I had an amazing time. Maybe next time   I would get my liquor courage, so  I would do my performance of \"baby got back\". Yes, I have done it before with all the dance move and back up dancers. Until next time people.  I will definitely come back again.

Alcohol isn't much of a challenge but candy, well, that's a different story.\n\nOne would think it's alcohol with all the dart taverns I'm at for dart league - but it's not the case. Even when I visited the Backstage Bar & Grill, it's wasn't for drinks. I came to eat.\n\n$5 1/2 pound burger with fries.\n\nIt's not a gourmet burger but it beats the hell out of fast food, any day and every day. Throw in TV's music, a pool table and a cute and friendly server, and I'm a fan.\n\nInside, it's dark. Not so dark you can't see anything but definitely very dimly lit which I actually don't mind. Lots of parking - street and a small lot though it was later in the evening when I showed up.\n\nI don't know if the make up of the clientele changes from night to night but on the night I showed up, there were people from all walks of life; a pretty good mix. I saw at least once bouncer to help keep everyone in line which wasn't necessary that night because it looked to be and felt that everyone was just there to have a good time.\n\nI know I did.\n$5 1/2 Pound Burger Special - includes fries. No typo - $5",

Also a bit older 25+ ish which is also a great place.\n\nThe food is also tasty. They have some amazing fries but that's not a dish one can easily mess up.\n\nThe service is ok. Most of the bartenders are nice and fast with the drinks. But the drinks are inconsistent. Good and cheap but if you ask for a whiskey sour you will get it seven different ways depending on who you get.\n\nParking isn't that bad. There's a reasonable amount of free street parking.\n\nOverall best and I think only karaoke bar in the downtown Culver area. And if I'm wrong, I know someone will let me know.",

He let us know we could bring our own cake for my birthday, explained where to park for our convenience, & that he'd follow up with me Thursday afternoon to confirm my party count, which he did! Since most of my friends & I didn't live close by, it was great to feel sure the drive would be worth it, knowing we'd be well taken care of! When we got there we were served all night by Sarah who was absolutely amazing! She was so attentive, kind, & positive. Just like Tim, it felt like she went out of her way to make us feel special & cared for!\n\nEveryone in my group loved their food & drinks all night, I was so impressed by everything I tried. The prices can't be beat with the quality!\n\nThe karaoke experience was really important to me & we had so much fun!!! The KJs were fun & talented, & also really friendly & made sure to honor mine & other people's birthdays every time we got up to sing! Their system runs really smoothly & organized too, it was just a pleasure all around!\n\nAnd finally because it's those little details that would make me this excited to write a gushing review, I can't leave out the fact that our whole party got a round of free birthday shots, they gave us plates, forks & napkins for my cake to be served on, & at midnight they served free Cheese quesadilla \"midnight snacks\" to the entire restaurant!!!\n\nThe intention & care in the details of this place & desire to make it so fun for their guests will bring me back here from Glendale again anytime, lol!!! I'll tell everyone I know how great you guys were!\n\nThank you for making my experience (& I'm sure many others) so special!",

Drinks were pretty strong and cheap. The clientele was on the friendlier side for LA. My only disappointment was that it was kind of a  long walk from downtown. Otherwise a good time.",

Ronnie is super rude, incredibly rude.  If they got rid of Ronnie I would come back. The other DJ (Shane) is pretty rude as well, but tolerable.  Drew (the security guy) is the the only thing this establishment has going for them.  Had 2 drinks, but Ronnie told bar tenders to cut me off because had \"too many drinks\" (2 drinks is too much). Don't waste your money or time.  I was very disappointed with the level of unprofessional behavior.  I came with a party of over 10 and we ordered tons of food, and this is how I get repaid.  Also, they do not have managers at the location at all times, which I find a little strange.\n\nUPDATE: Just got notified by Ronnie that it was because I broke the sign up rules.  I signed up myself with a friend, but the friend didn't come over to the sign up with me, which apparently is not allowed.",

We had a fabulous time and couldn't speak highly enough of this venue for the happy hour we threw!\n\nWe didn't need to rent out the entire bar, they didn't require a minimum, they provided wristbands for our party, they allowed us to take advantage of the happy hour food prices.....and the food was delicious too!\n\nThanks again!

It's easy to find because it's right across from the Sony Pictures Lot.  \n\nWhether you come on karaoke night or trivia night, the emcees always keep it fun and entertaining.  Dress is casual (but no thug attire) and better get there early if you want to get your name on the list to sing a song.  On karaoke nights, don't be surprised if you find a line out the door 10-20 people deep.  Usually the wait isn't more than 5-15 minutes to get in and the crowd is mixed.  \n\nOne time I came and there were these two white guys hamming it up for a hip-hop song.  I was thinking, \"Wow, they are cheesy, well rehearsed, but funny as heck.\"  A year later I turn on VH1 and there's one of the guys!  He must've been a music critic or industry insider because he was commenting on one of those VH1 artist countdowns (like 50 Top One Hit Wonders, 50 Best Grunge Acts, etc).  \n\nFor trivia night after lots of questions asked in a Christopher Walken voice, two tables were tied so to break it they had a white girl with glasses battle rapping against a Jewish guy with a City of London shirt.  \"You're wearin' a yarmulke, but I celebrate both Christmas and Hanukkah!\"  To finish him off, she said, \"Your shirt says London, but after this battle you be done-done.\"  Just off the top hilarious.  \n\nCome here if you want to drink, sing, dance, and just be stupid with your friends while making new ones.  If you're looking for a lounge with $15 drinks and a high brow ambiance trying to pass as a place to be seen, then this ain't your joint.  But if you wanted to sample a Culver City Slut... that's definitely on the menu!\nBeer & Wine List.\nDo you want a Culver City Slut or would you rather feel Absolutely F**king Fabulous?",

This place is a decent place to come after a tough day at work.  Or if you want to sing karaoke, or just because.  I guess according to LA prices it is cheap.  My drink still runs me a pretty penny, however it's not the $15 DTLA prices so that's good.  The security dudes are really cool and not trying hard to be difficult which is good.  I usually sit at the bar.  I luv sitting at the bar for some reason and the bartenders are always quick and friendly.  \n\nThere is ALWAYS karaoke going on here, therefore it is ALWAYS loud.  It is very difficult to have a conversation, so.. hey.. just drink.\n\nThe food:  The garlic fries are really good so if you are on a diet... I wouldn't recommend trying one because one turns into 50.  The teriyaki wings?  OMgoodness.  So good.  The sauce was really on point.  My friend Elaine would LUB them... lol.. anyhoo, you would not expect for the food to be so good here but it is.  Lastly, they have cider beer! That's always a plus when you are not a beer drinker.

The patrons are fun outgoing crazy and adventurous. In the end its just a great fun time.\n\nThe karaoke is what brings people here if you hadnt figured that one out by now. There are thousands of songs and some will get everyone singing along with you. The last time I was here, song long haired asian dude brought the place down singing paradise city from GnR. Everyone was singing along and this place was hopping and bopping.  Several people did some great christmas songs as well.\n\nHeck there must have been 20-30 people out of 200-300 in costumes of various sorts. Just pure unabashed fun times.\n\nI highly suggest visiting this place sometime. It is pure fun even if you are not a singer like me. You dont have to grab the mic, just come and enjoy the show and a cocktail or three. It is well worth your time. =D",

First of all, drinks and food are really cheap AND we missed happy hour.  We were able to get 4 well drinks for the price of one in weho.  And watch out.. the pours are heavy hunnnnnny.\n\nTo soak up the booze we also ordered some awesome bar food.  Listen to me and the rest of the reviews underneath me and get the Mac N Cheese.  It is decadent in all the right ways.\n\nThe crowd was also amazing!  A lot of the people there can actually sing pretty well, but even when a terrible singer like myself got a turn, everyone still crowded the dance floor and partied like their ears wern't bleeding.  This is the place to get your belligerent American Idol fantasy on.",

They have a pretty good mix of music so you will most likely here something you like throughout the night.\n\nIf you are big fan of Karaoke but feel intimated by the LA scene this is a good place to sing your heart out.

One's perspective can be best understood as the sum of one's experiences.  With that said, I can barely sing Happy Birthday in tune, so in a comparison of myself to other singers, heck I thought there were some damn good singers, potential American Idols, at this karaoke bar.  \n\nVery casual, old (d\u00e9cor nothing impressive), dark, loud, dive bar filled with a variety of friendly people -varying in ethnicity and age.  One group, had to be 20-something-year-old women who were having a bachelorette party there, one older woman with salt-and-pepper colored hair rolled up with her walker to the mic, and -so do you get a clearer picture of the crowd at the Backstage Bar?  \n\nRegardless of the crowd, I had a great time here -My group danced, drank and cheered on the karaoke performances.  The emcee of karaoke is this Filipino-looking guy who had great energy to keep the crowd entertained and gave our group a round of free shots (for being my friend's \"birthday\"-lol).  Heck, management gave away free slices of a cheese quesadilla that night too-that's awesome! I didn't try the food here, but the adult drinks are pretty weak -so bring a roadie or flask if you need a little liquid courage to get you up to that mic!",

First for Karaoke on Friday night and then the Hawks game on Sunday!\n\nFirst off, Karaoke at Backstage is NO JOKE! You have to get there early if you want to put your name on the list and the place is packed! They've got a great selection, the vibe is incredible and the staff is super nice!\n\nSecondly, possibly a tad bias of me, but I may also be in love with this place because they truly are the home of Seahawks fans of the SoCAL & boy have I missed a bar with a ton of Hawks fans! Literally felt like I had been transported back home to WA with everyone in Hawks gear and going crazy over bad calls from the refs.\n\nNeedless to say they've also got great food and a good selection with that. Highly recommend if you're looking for a dive bar, karaoke bar, place to watch the Seahawks game or simple an awesome place with a killer Happy Hour!",

Guy bartenders are nice and welcoming, girls chat to each other more than looking to see who's thirsty.  Went in the other night to have a beer and ordered a pint of Firestone 805 and again, was not cold and not crisp.  Let's say lukewarm and flat tasting.  Rather than raise a ruckus, as I had another engagement to get to, I forced myself to quaff it down (which was not easy).  \n\nFor a quick comparison, just the night before I was at Springbok Tavern in Van Nuys on Victory Blvd.,  (which I'd recommend) and ordered the same pint of 805 - cool, crisp, chilled, fantastic tasting and how it should taste.  It's how Firestone intended it to taste, not how The Backstage serves it.  Perhaps they're cheapening out on their chilling system, clogged maybe, not flushed often enough, who knows or maybe they feel since their happy hour goes till 8p (to which they've recently raised prices by a buck) they can get away with serving warm beer.  Not the case!  I'll be heading to Rush Street or Public School where they care for their loyal customers.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool 2\n8/12/2014Previous review\nCold beers now at the Backstage, thanks for fixing!  Now howz about revamping that food menu :)\nRead more\n6/17/2014Previous review\nPlace is OK, dark (which is good if yer trying to stay low key) and the beer is always NOT cold enough.  I get it, not all draft beer is going to be super cold, nor should it be, however, it should not be just above room temp, which this seems to be.  \n\nThere is something wrong with the draft beer maintenance at this bar, which was confirmed by one of the clueless bartenders who let the cat out of the bag.  I would come here a lot more often if I knew the beer would be cold.  I typically get Racer 5 at many local WLA bars and this is the only place where there is a temperature problem.\n\nCould be because they don't clean the lines, or they don't drive the beer cold with Co2.  Food is passable, tried the chicken tacos once and they were ok, what you'd expect from a neighborhood dive.  ",

                  "review": "SEAHAWKS BAR OF SOCAL\n\nFYI, there are times Sherman's mom comes to watch the games here. Not often but I've heard she's there sometimes.\n\nGrowing up in Seattle, my 206 network is very large. And apparently, everybody thinks I should be a Seahawks fan because that is \"home\". Unfortunately, Seattle is not my first home and SF is my first home and my birth city... which makes me a 49ers fan over a Seahawks fan. My Seattle friends that live in SoCal always try to drag me to this bar and I refuse even though it is down the street from my apartment. Well, I went to meet up with some Seattle-to-LA friends to watch the November 2015 match up between Seahawks and 49ers. AND they know better to not ask me to go there again. LOL\n\n1) Odd bar. Definitely a dive bar and definitely attacks the weirdest people besides the Seahawks fans. Like old dude who carries a picture of the pope and says the pope is talking to him. LOL i can't knock on the dude too much because he's holding a picture of the pope but are you serious?!?!?!\n\n2) Food is bar food and that bar food isn't all that great.\n\n3) For a Seahawks fan this is probably a great hangout. They give free shots during half-time, the crowd is fun and mature. I was the only 49er fan up in there and nobody gave me a hard time.\n\n4) SO DARK. literally, it is a cave up in there.\n\nWill I be back? Not my kind of scene.",

So i wonder why. Maybe bad pour. So i asked for another one. Still tasted flat. Maybe because the beer some how was left open and it becane flat. I left the first day disappointed.\n\nThe second time. I dare say this place waters out there beers. All their beers. I had ever beer.\n\nWont be returning!!!

By far one of the worst burgers I had ever eaten in my life. Had I not been starving I would have taken great pride in feeding the local stray dogs with this dry burger. It tasted as if the cook had pressed all the juice out of the burger. I can taste when food is cooked with love , this burger tasted like Joseph Stalin personally cooked this burger himself.

If that's not enough to sell you on it, this might not be the place for you. But you had me at karaoke!\n\nBackstage is completely opposite from the standard bar in LA because it is not pretentious at all, the drinks are cheap and strong, and the people are actually there only to have a good time: no one is dressed to impress or there just for a casual drink. People get straight up aggressive with their drinking here! The music is always upbeat, with the crowd singing (or--in most cases--screaming) along with the performers. In fact, I don't think I've ever actually signed up for karaoke here, but I've sung and danced a ton as an onlooker.\n\nI definitely recommend coming for the Happy Hour food and drink deals (4-8pm every day) and staying for the karaoke, which starts nightly at 8pm.",

Like momentarily almost pitch black from the contrast of the bright summer daylight.  Your eyes adjust eventually, but it's still pretty dark for a small space.\n\nMain reason for disappointment?

Ben was very reassuring and nice which made me feel confident a fun night was in store. I was told there would be tables reserved and a toast would be made where Jolly Rancher shots or something of the sort would be passed out to my group. Got there about 8:45/9 the evening of. People were sitting in our tables but the staff was quick to kick them out which was nice.\n\nSigned up for karaoke and the KJ was insanely rude. Told me he couldn't \"read\" my name and asked how I would expect him to call me up if he couldn't read my name. I asked him to please be nice because it was my birthday and Ill rewrite the name to which he responded, \"I am nice but if you don't write your name legibly I won't be.\" Meanwhile, while this is going on the complete stranger standing next to us kept saying, \"Aleah right? It says Aleah?\" If the complete stranger can read and pronounce it just fine, then why couldn't the KJ?\n\nI went back up a few minutes later to write down a duet for my friend and I to do. I was told only one song per person per night. Ridiculous. It's my birthday. I want to do a duet with my best friend.\n\nCut to 3 1/2hours later. No ones name had yet to be called from my party. When I went back up to inquire there was a sidekick there working with the KJ who was clearly annoyed I was checking the status.\n\nNeedless to say I'm very disappointed I chose this place for my birthday celebration, especially since not one person from our group got called up to sing as if 12:30 and said toast never happened.\n\nI do want to add that our server, Catalina, was very nice and efficient. So don't take this review to mean the service lagged because she was awesome.\nUseful 4\nFunny 4\nCool 1\nSam P.\nBusiness Customer Service",

The bar wasn't too crowded and it was a pretty subdued group of people just chit chatting in the bar.\n\nThe reason it gets 3 stars is that the karaoke was waaaaaaaaaaay too loud and the treble was way too high. I normally will subject myself to loud music at a bar/club, but the volume of the karaoke was way too loud for the space of the venue. I was basically screaming at the person next to me to talk to them. I ended up leaving after one drink. Will have to try again on another day that is not karaoke, or bring ear plugs next time.",

It doesn't seem like the bartenders or maybe bouncer are regulating their patrons consumption. My last visit resulted in a lady stumbling into the \"do not walk\" crosswalk as I turned to try to find parking.\n\nAlso, limited parking. Street parking in the residential results in tickets after 6pm, forcing folks to part in the garage across the street and walk over.",

So great place to let loose and have a great time.\n\nThere's a \"working\" photo booth in the back that my friends also decided to use..if you end up using it, make sure to be patient for the delivery of your oics..they do come out and it does work..but it takes about a song or two before the pictures pop out for you..\n\nSecond time I went, we got there a little earlier and managed to get on the karaoke list but the wait time is crazy even at 8 pm..but we tried the garlic fries and chicken sandwich/burger and wow! Never expected for food to taste as amazing as it did! Must get for sure! Pretty great prices on their drinks as well..really great place..\n\nMUCH BETTER THAN BLIND BARBER, they denied me for wearing shorts and sandals..this place didnt, so MUCH MUCH BETTER!",

I was actually thrown out earlier this week (new customer) because I dared to question the bartender's incredible ignorance and lack of civic appreciation for the debate between Clinton and Trump. Not just thrown out, but 86D permanently. As a former doorman, I rarely see the level of outright unprofessional behavior I experienced here.\n\nThis bartender lost his patience very quickly, like a child, when I prodded him about why he would not turn the sound on. His idiotic and probably bullshit response. \"The owner does not like political stuff in here.\" I was waiting for the ADUHHH at the end of the sentence but unfortunately did not get the payoff on that.\n\nThis ignorant response got me a little irritated so I began to ask some questions about why he and other employees of the bar were so apathetic about an event tantamount to a critical moment in our nation's history, regardless of one's thoughts or feelings about the candidates.\n\nHe popped off with some garbage about how I was now irritating him, grabbed up my tab and more or less threw it at me telling me to get out with the bouncer backing him up 100%. They would not even let me finish the mediocre cheeseburger I was in the middle of eating.\n\nThe fact that you hire people like this says a lot about your judgement, and if the bartender was accurate about the fact that political discourse or national political events on TV are not tolerated in your establishment. If this is the case, maybe you should go live in another fucking country with your clueless bartender and doorman.\n\nIf that is not the case, then I apologize for the statement above which obviously does not apply to you anyway, but I urge you to terminate both of these knuckleheads for conduct unbecoming, so egregiously unprofessional that it should not even be tolerated in a dive bar.",

They were able to accommodate all even with a \"reserved for Brooke\" sign on each table.\n**After I made the reservations a month ago, I received 2 follow up calls from Ben confirming the reservations (he was so helpful and nice!!)\n**Bridget and Erin our servers were SO pleasant and very attentive. I never felt like we were annoying them or badgering them.\n**Karaoke sign-up FILLS UP FAST here. By 10:30 the list was already full. I had already sung my song but I really wanted to thank all of my party guests for coming to celebrate with me. When I asked the MC of the Karaoke if I could do this, he was so sweet and let me come up to say a few words.\n\nAll in all I cannot RAVE ENOUGH about my experience here.\n**Laid Back Vibe\n**Complimentary Birthday Shots\n**Complimentary Reservations\n**Accommodating and extremely positive staff\n\nI'm so happy I celebrated my birthday with Backstage, and I will definitely be having other parties here!!",

The recipe seems simple. Is it?\n\nOne part Dive Bar\nOne part Karaoke Bar\nOne part Studio Hang-out\nOne part Sports Bar\nOne part Burger Restaurant\nApply Happy Hour to taste\nTop it off with a Pool Table\n\nThe Happy Hour from 4:00-8:00 SEVEN DAYS A WEEK offers $2 domestic beers, $3 well drinks, and half-price appetizers. Since it's happy hour and not a Weight Watcher's meeting, my recommendations are the Jalapeno Poppers, Chili Cheese Fries, or the Nachos with Steak.\n\nFor a brew, the Backstage Pale Ale is ok, but others like Newcastle, Fat Tire, or Blue Moon may be better for your mood. There are plenty of mixed drinks that seem popular with the ladies like the Culver City Slut, Nuts & Berries, Kool-Aid, or a shot of Kahlua, Baileys, and Vodka topped with Whipped Cream that you MUST drink without your hands.\n\nStick around after HH because at 8:00 on Thursday, Friday & Saturday, it's Karaoke Night. That's right. Drunk people \"singing\" their favorite tunes while you laugh and drink more. The DJ does a pretty decent job of keeping it moving. In general, the service is good. It's a busy bar, so, don't expect to be waited on hand & foot cause it doesn't happen.\n\nThe place is smaller than it sounds and gets incredibly busy during sporting events (10 TVs) or karaoke. Parking is the biggest problem. Do NOT park on the side streets south of Culver Blvd. cause it is hard-core Permit Only. Grab a spot on the north side of the street and work your way across.\n\nIf you're tired of the Disney-esque places in downtown Culver City, come to this local legend across from Sony Studios. The Backstage Bar & Grill simply delivers food, fun, and drinks. Leave your ego at the door.",

Once we mustard our selves through one taco we- saw a plate of chicken tenders walk by and we had instant fomo.- we definitely are going to give this another try because the atmosphere is really cool!",

Strong enough to get me rapping Eminem in front of everyone on the karaoke stage. Even did a group number of \"Its a Hardknock Life\" by Annie. The song book is at the bar and literally has any song you can think of and even ones you've forgotten about.Good times with a great crowd! Makes terrible singers feel like Whitney Houston out there. Also we went through tons of sweet potato and garlic fries, the bomb.com.",

They also serve food until midnight if my memories serves me correctly. We \"borrowed\" a plate full of garlic fries that someone had left behind on the table next to us, which were pretty freaking amazing. Btw, please refrain from judging us: our intoxication had reached a surprisingly high level and our bellies were very empty. Maybe the chef was a little overly enthusiastic about the garlic though.\n\nThe karaoke was going non-stop all night with a wide range from serious, talented performers giving a great show, to drunken attempts of keeping up with the lyrics and hitting the right notes. Nonetheless, the crowd got down to most of the performances.\n\nI came here expecting a few beers and decent couple of karaoke performances but ended up leaving excited to return!",

Karaoke  is on here all the time or everytime I am here.  Great dinning for a bar that is. Locals bar for sure but there are all nice and no one bit me and that's always it's a win in my book. As I look better in the dark I get braver and got 5 phone numbers and 2 actually worked. They had lots of booze to ease the pain of finding out 3 numbers where bogus. Thus I must come here more often to become a local and then I can get half the bad jokes I heard as they must be funny if I knew what the hell they meant. Cassadilla was just amazing at midnight and I told the girl that just came in at midnight I bought the whole bar food. Overall I just love this place because I get laughs for my bad jokes and I look 20 pounds lighter.\nFull bar",

It definitely has some charm to it, and you can tell that the bar is a bit older with that divey, rustic feel.. But I like to refer to that as character.\n\nThe food is pretty good. I mostly stick to the burgers and fries and haven't had any complaints. We usually get a big basket of fries and some wings to go with our beers while we wait for our turn to sing.\n\nIf you go on Karaoke night, be sure to get there early - otherwise you'll be waiting about an hour or so for your name to come up. And if you go on a Friday or Saturday, it gets pretty packed quickly!",

I walked right out of Sony Studios after being on Wheel of Fortune and instead of calling a cab I walked into Backstage. I happened to sit right by the dance floor and order my delectable food that included crispy brussels sprouts and chicken fingers with pleasantly piquant garlic fries. Although, I had just won a mother load and was prepared to irresponsibly spend a good chunk of my new fortune in celebration, IT WAS HAPPY HOUR AND ALL THAT FOOD ONLY COST $10!!!\n\n       * it is officially unconfirmed on how much was spent on drinks.\n\nThe karaoke was slammin'! A few of these people could really blow. I was into it, and I was chair dancing like I was out of town and nobody knew who I was... Because, I was out of town and nobody knew who I was. Speaking of that, I thought LA was supposed to be expensive. These prices were as good as the prices in Kansas, if not even better. Is the cost of living in a big city really astronomically higher than it is in small-town America, or is this a huge ruse being pulled on us country bumpkins?  \n\nAre we really saving money by exercising our prerogative to live in small towns? Or, instead would we flow like a harpoon daily and nightly in the big city? I think if I made the move and turned out the lights, I'd probably glow. Although, there is the chance that everybody would be talking all that stuff about me and I'd want them to just let me live. Uh...Agent Luke...you lost me. Back to the celebration...\n\nTo top it off, the DJ was playing music videos on the TV screens from way back in the 90's. I saw the iconic videos for Ice Ice Baby, My Prerogative, and Come On Over........In case you don't know that is Vanilla Ice, Bobby Brown, and Christina Aguilera!  Yeeaheeeeeyay!!!! (Pronounced:  yeh-eeeeeeeee-yeh-ay in OG intonation)\n\nI then ubered (first time ever and so so easy) my way back to the telly for a predetermined $8.26.  I wonder if I could have requested a ragtop so my hair could blow.\n\nLukey T, outta here\nWord to Yo Motha\n\nIce Ice Baby\nToo cold, too cold.",

I walked in on a Saturday night meeting some friends for a birthday party.  I thought I was just walking into a bar, I didn't realize Id stay til it closed because I was having that much fun.  It's the type of place where the regulars know everyone by name.  They quickly took me in as one of their own and by the end of the night, I had talked to almost all the friendly staff!  The drinks were good, the garlic fries delicious, and the people (patrons and staff were amazing!).  I also ordered Brussels sprouts and buffalo strips which were yummy and a base for my drinks!  Karaoke was going on and the whole bar was fully into it!  And everyone just seemed soo friendly - everyone was singing and dancing the whole time with strangers as if they were long time friends!  Meanwhile, the waitress and bartenders kept us well fed and hydrated.  I wish there was a place like this close to me, but let me tell you....this place was soo welcoming, it's worth it for me to make the trek out there and pretend to be a regular :)  cheers to you guys and making an environment that makes everyone feel special!",

It happens, but normal people don't need to freak out about it. Also don't depend on security/staff to do anything effective even if they see you hold your hands up as they witness other people harass and throw drinks on you. Instead we chose to leave.
