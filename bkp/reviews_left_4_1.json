They also have really good morning hours, plenty of dining tables, and have order in advance to make everything convenient to visit. Lastly, my toddler loves the food. She loves the avocado toast and we add 2 sunny side up eggs to give her extra protein. I love that the roast comes with pickled kohlrabi (which reminds us of Koran pickled radish), a citrusy green herb sauce, and you ca. request a side of their house fermented hot sauce.\n\nThe pastries are delicious--moist banana bread and blueberry muffin, or crispy chocolate chip cookie. And I always order an English muffin with a side of jam. All the food at GGET feels fresh and homemade.\n\nOh and the coffee is good. The beans do t taste burnt and the lattes/cappuccinos are so creamy.\n\nLastly, staff is so nice and friendly. It's always hard dining with a toddler but staff always smile and are accommodating.",

Lol I don't have a picture but it just felt like the food here is insanely overpriced like I could go to a nice brunch place and get better value for my money. I got a breakfast burrito for $14 here and it was tiny! Like probably the size of a soda can! Okay maybe a little larger but when I can get regular sized burritos that taste way better at taquerias a mile down the street then I have no business spending $14 for a small average breakfast burrito. It's ok. It's my fault. I learned my lesson.\n\nCome here for the coffee and the nice people working here. Don't make the same mistake I did and just skip the food and eat elsewhere.",

Right by Sony picture studio.\n\nAmbiance: Simple, modern, casual. Very roomy. Lots of seating inside and outside.\n\nMenu: Coffee, tea, pastries, light meals.\n\nService: Quick and friendly\n\nParking: Walk a few blocks for street parking. Limited.\n\n- Gluttony Expedition -\nCappuccino: lighter body, lots of acidity, ground bean \"coffee\" after taste. Smooth and mild overall.\n\nChorizo breakfast burrito: it's smaller size than usual, but perfect. Great flavor with nice kick of spiciness. Great!\n\nEnglish muffin with scrambled egg and avocado: It's a bit hard to eat but cooked well. Good.\n\n- Conqueror's Deduction -\nFood: 4 stars. Coffee: 3 stars.\n\nI'll come back for food, but not so much for coffee. I think it's a decent coffee (definitely better than average), but I still prefer \"Blue bottle\", which is heavier, smoother and creamier well-round coffee. Foods are actually tasty, well-portioned (which means a bit smaller than usual, but perfect size for me).\nSee all photos from Akiko I. for Go Get Em Tiger",

GGET or (Go Get 'Em Tiger) has 8 locations around town, so pick the one closest to you :) The staff is very personable and professional and their menu is delicious. I usually get the oat milk cappuccino, but one day they were out of oat milk! In the spirit of community, Tyler suggested two nearby coffee places that would satisfy my preference and I appreciated that very much. Daniela also offered a gift one day after seeing me come in several days a week (thank you)!\n\nTheir blueberry corn muffin is the only sweet I have tried and I liked both the texture and the restraint of sugar use in the muffin.\n\nWhen I can't really eat much, I order the granola with oat milk and I am always happy with the lighter coconut granola and gigantic golden raisins in it!\n\nA slightly more substantial breakfast is their scrambled eggs and biscuit with a side of avocado for $11 with a fermented hot sauce that is addictive!\n\nTheir protein breakfast for $13 includes the perfect scrambled eggs, brilliant bacon, side salad and avocado. An ideal meal for those who love this combo :)\n\nTheir breakfast sandwich is what I grab on the go, made with their homemade English muffin, sausage, egg, roasted tomatoes and spicy aioli for $9 this is a perfect choice when you are not too hungry but need to sustain yourself until lunch.\n\nLunch can be the chicken avocado sandwich for $12 on beautiful Bub and Grandma's focaccia with fris\u00e9e.\n\nTheir burger for $12 is 5 ounces of old fashioned nostalgia, with Cooper's American cheese, caper aioli, grilled onions, and butter pickles. Get smashed potatoes on the side for $4 and then call your cardiologist :)\n\nFor hunger pangs, their burrito for $12 with bacon, avocado, eggs is the way to go. The only salad at the Culver City location is the chicken kale caesar for $15 . It's easy to get to GGET, but the quality ingredients, deft use of them, and the wonderfully personable staff are the main reasons I keep going back.\nSee all photos from Elaine T. for Go Get Em Tiger",

They add an aioli sauce to the sandwich that gave it a tangy flavor, It was so delicious! I've also tried their Breakfast Sandwich and the Avocado Toast. Although I was not a big fan of how greasy the Breakfast Sandwich was, it still tasted really good. Their Avo Toast though....no words but just DELICIOUS! The bread is perfectly toasted, the avocado is thinly sliced and the toppings just make it super tangy, salty and delicious!\n\nTheir coffee of course is great! Nice and roasted but not super bold. If you're like me and like a little sweetener, make sure you let them know! The gentleman helping me yesterday was so nice and offered to add it to my coffee since they don't carry syrups. Overall, GGET is awesome! Location is beautiful, enough tables to get some work done outside. Definitely my new little spot!",

It's on the bottom of a big office building next to some medical facilities, where there's seating outside for customers to enjoy on a nice day. The place was busy around 11:00 AM, but the employees were working fast and efficiently to get the food out.  \n\nWe had a big order so I was excited to see how the plates looked/tasted. The menu isn't huge for breakfast, but the Breakfast Burrito and Protein Brekkie looked most enticing. I went with the breakfast burrito, which was absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe ingredients all work really well together, highlighted by perfectly cooked chorizo, scrambled eggs, and potatoes. Though I wasn't a fan of the side of the side of salsa and didn't think it added much to the burrito. While the acidity was nice, the flavors were off.\n\nThe burrito was excellent, and to be honest, one of the best I have had. I hope to be back soon to get my hands on that Protein Brekkie, which looks incredibly healthy and delicious. Wherever you are in LA, a Go Get Em Tiger is most likely in sight, so try to make the effort and give em a shot. Totally worth it.\nBreakfast Burrito",

Not sure but it was a little bit to much to have a little pooling of oil.\n\nBut other than that, this place had amazing grub. Oooooofffff. Eggs on point, biscuit on point, bacon??? You guessed.. twas in point.\n\nThe almond/Mac and latte???!! AMAZING! If you are a coffee lover you will not be disappointed. Latte is espresso and steamed milk.... If you are having a super sweet milk drink with coffee it is not really a latte if you can't taste the coffee!!\nThis place DID NOT DISAPPOINT!! You could taste the nuts and the coffee so we'll. A true latte! Had me ready to swing from building to building haha\n\nThe customer service was great as well. There was an issue with our biscuits, but they came out to let us know, and when the issue was taking even longer they gave us a free cookie to help with the wait :) Things happen, but not every joint is ready to give something away to keep a customer happy",

The problem is...somehow in the last 6 months the quality has gone downhill.\n\nThe appeal for me was as a place where you could get a limited menu of outstanding things, like their burger (which they discontinued because of some issue making the bun).   Their breakfast sandwich was one of the best I ever had, (now made without the original english muffin and fennel...it's just ok now and the eggs in it which were perfectly runny medium are now often overcooked).\n\nThe coffee has always just been a B but the appeal, again, was the food.    Today I ordered a simple breakfast, two eggs over medium, sliced avocado, some bacon (just reheat), and lettuce (put on plate).  For 17.   The eggs came scrambled because of a breakdown in communication between cashier and kitchen.\n\nThey remade the eggs and they came overcooked.  This is the second time this has happened.  The first time they said \"sorry\".  Not, \"Sorry, can we make you some eggs correctly now\".    \n\nObviously they can't keep the place staffed correctly and consistency in the kitchen.   Which is the appeal of the business in my mind   Making that limited menu of outstanding things.   Of course the margin is in the coffee, but for me, the food is what got me in the door to buy the average coffee, otherwise Superdomestic across the street.\n\nWithout that, it is a trendy name with B level coffee and pastries.\n\nIt's too bad because the people are really nice, I really hope that management can solve their people problems and bring back some good food!",

So how could I not stop by frequently!\n\nThis place never disappoints. I love their biscuits --  they're tender, crumbly, and buttery good! Especially the egg biscuit sandwich. Which is to die for. They have lots of options of sweet treats, pastries, and breakfasts. So whatever you're in the mood for you can grab it and go!\n\nI typically order an iced cappuccino with oat milk and it is perfect here! It's strong, smooth, and packed with delicious espresso flavor. I would come here every day if I could!\n\nThis week they were doing a \"Ted Lasso\" week and were selling any drink for $1 with Apple Pay and you received delicious shortbread cookies! Literally the best things I've ever eaten. The packaging was so cute and I will be coming back all week!\n\nDefinitely a must try place if you're looking for good coffee (or tea!) and delicious food! Really hoping they open up one in the Valley sometime soon!\nTed lasso week shortbread biscuits!\nTed lasso week! Delicious shortbread biscuits and an iced cappuccino with oat milk!",

Came on a sunny day and while it was starting to feel sort of hot, it also felt really nice to be sitting outside on a nice day, with some nice food and drinks with a friend. I really enjoyed my chorizo breakfast burrito and the salsa that came with it. Great recommendation from the person taking my order. Also, good call on telling me how it probably wouldn't have been a good to add a shot of espresso to the Tumeric Almond Macademia Latte, haha. Totally understood why once I got the drink. For that reason, I also wanted coffee so I ordered a shot of espresso. I was really impressed by the way it came out and how the guy who initially helped me had hand delivered it to me. I like the little wooden tray it fit perfectly on with a shot of one of their fizzy teas to cleanse the palette. Street parking was kind of difficult, but only because most spots were taken already except the 15 minute or loading type areas. It's great seeing how the area of Culver City has been developing throughout the years.\nSee all photos from Allie P. for Go Get Em Tiger",

The oat latte was just okay and I am not sure it's worth $7. Burrito was also very tiny and salsa had no spice whatsoever. Overall a nice place but a bit overpriced.

I've ordered their $7 basque cheesecake. It's pretty small and thin. Even though it's supposed to be basque, mine wasn't all that burnt with a rich, dark surface.

I recommend the blueberry corn muffin or the vegan strawberry muffin. But I also remember getting this breakfast plate with bacon and scrambled eggs. Forgot the name--but holy crap--too good.\n\nIf anything, the place is pricey but it's an experience. Given the COVID era we're in, I love to sit outside by the steps and taking in the amazing city that is Culver City\nSee all photos from Tristan A. for Go Get Em Tiger",

Here's why:  1) I frequent \"gget\" because its pretty tasty food/drink (rating 6/10) so close to work so I wanted to love this place; and 2) They are friendly and tries their best to make customers happy.  Over time however, the remaining \"cons\" will outweigh these \"pros\".  Con 1) Their unreliable service. More often than not, something goes wrong with my order especially if I'm not ordering it in person. Con 2) Basic mobil app is glitchy.  Just today when I tired to order and confirmed for payment so many times it wouldn't go through that I ended up having to call them with my order and made sure they didn't charge me multiple times.  Con 3) Overpriced.  I'm all for paying extra for something yummy but for example, this sad looking bacon, egg & cheese on English muffin (pic attached)? It was $9.00 (not including \"employee wellness\" fee & tax) for something I could make at home (and would not be as greasy). Was the up-charge in the \"homemade\" English muffin part?! It was certainly nothing to write home about. It was just so lazily put together and tasted like such.  Just take a look at the menu and you'll see other items like $14 breakfast burrito or $7 latte, etc.  and last but probably not least, Con 4) They took off the best item on the menu (I can hear the groaning of my co-workers now).  They HAD one of the tastiest (albeit greasy) hamburgers in town!!  Otherwise, it's worth giving it a try, and I mean only the breakfast foods, pastries and coffees but pass on anything else - unless they bring that burger back!\nBacon, (scrambled) egg & cheese on \"homemade\" english muffin ($9+$\"employee wellness\"fee+tax).",

Is the the caper aioli applies in perfect portion? The sweet pickles? Lean seasoned beef? I dunno. But this burger is the boss. The absolute boss.\n\nEdit from 7/18: went back today for a donut - a churro donut with just the perfectly balanced amount of apricot glaze. Sweet but not too sweet. I usually don't even like donuts, or apricot. But this thing is deliciously.\n\nAnother update from 7/25: tried the Vegan strawberry muffin and the almond mac nut latte iced. The muffin is good - not to sweet but the strawberry flavor shines through. Another must try\n\nI feel like I stumbled upon Culver City, nay, Southern California's biggest secrets.\nVegan strawberry muffin",

I like the location and you can easily find 2-hour free parking in the area. Although, I would like to find a better option because I can totally see this coffee shop becoming my go-to for coffee and work :)\nIt was one of my first times here so Paul convinced me to stay in instead of getting a take out. I wanted to try their business and pleasure which is their version of a coffee flight. I loved the macademia latte! They gave it to me on the house! After a while, I wanted to get a vegan strawberry muffin but they were out of those. So the barista suggested a newer date/orange cake option and also offered it to me on the house. Since I already got the coffee on the house, I felt like the decent thing to do was to pay for the cake :) They are all incredibly nice and happy to talk to customers. Can't wait to be back and make this my weekend study spot :)",

I asked for Splenda which they didn't have and then I asked for Stevia which they also didn't have  and was told they just have  a simple syrup with brown sugar. My drink was $2.00 more than most mochas I have had in CC. My drink was to go. I asked for the little stopper for the hole in the lid. They did not have that either.  I heard great things about their coffee but I will be staying with the The Conservatory on Washington where I can get soy milk and Splenda at a much more reasonable price.

I use the QR code and it says I can only order merchandise or whole coffee, which is weird, so I call again. NOW their voicemail says they're closed today through Thursday.

I cannot believe how delicious this breakfast burrito is. It literally is the best one I've every had. The potatoes are just a bit crispy, to give them and interested texture, and the spices in it are out of this world. I can't tell if it's the salsa or the chorizo sausage, but it's amazing.\n\nAnd the coffee is really great, too. I don't get why it's so amazing, but it is.\n\nI may go back for lunch. It was that good. Also, the person at the door was friendly and polite, which is a nice plus.",

I ordered online while I was half asleep so I could go pickup some breakfast burrito, apple turnover for the kid and coffee. I ordered and somehow didn't realize that \"20% tip\" was auto-checked and I just clicked through not realizing. Although there was an option to un-check at the end, I didn't notice it. I find it a bit of deceptive business practices to keep 20% tip checked automatically at checkout. You should change that on the website ordering to let people review it. Trust me on this one. That said, the GGET breakfast burrito although small for $11 tasted good and fresh. Kid loved the apple turnover. I ordered the iced almond macadamia latte w/ extra shot and it was EXTREMELY bitter. I added more milk once at home which helped. I love coffee but wow that was a shock of bitterness. I would say \"maybe\" to returning here but will definitely watch the auto tip function next time. Customer service was GREAT and the employee offered my tip money back which I declined.\nGGET breakfast burrito and almond macadamia latte iced.",

We had an Iced mocha and a breakfast sandwich - both were very tasty.

Their quality is pretty decent. We ordered the usual: pork belly, bulgogi, brisket, marinated short rib, beef belly. We unfortunately didn't save room for the beef tongue but the standout to me was the beef belly. I thought it was delicious. The short rib was pretty good and the rest were pretty average. The banchan was nothing special but did the job. We had to ask a few times for rice paper, kimchi, and jalapeno/garlic refills.\nService was not that great but they were busy and seemed short-staffed (like everyone else these days) so I won't knock them for that.\nParking was easy and free in the lot behind the restaurant. I definitely recommend checking it out if you want to stay on the westside and have KBBQ",

Everything from the sides to the soups were fantastic as well. I will also say do your best to make a reservation before coming here simply because they do get busy as does any Korean barbecue place... So I highly suggest making a reservation otherwise you'll find yourself waiting and it could detour from the experience.\n\nThe environment : This restaurant's not extremely huge But they definitely made the best out of the space that they have. They are abiding by the coveted safety precautions and require masks on entry. They did not ask for our vaccination cards but just be prepared if needs be.\n\nThe service: our host was fantastic and very attentive, A couple times you can tell he was getting overwhelmed from running the tables and some of his other teammates did their best to compliment for the rush. So I definitely appreciate how they worked as a team. When we asked for meat are we feels uncertain things they were reasonably quick about it so thank you guys.\n\nThe food: It's Korean BBQ lol... It's meat meat and more meat haha The cuts were pretty much on par with most places I've been to. I will say the short rib was absolutely delicious. I especially enjoyed their tofu soup just be careful because both their tofu soup and their egg pot soup come out really hot. Bad a variety of sides were all pretty delicious so no knocks there.\n\nWe came here for a friend's birthday and overall the experience was fantastic and he had a great time so that was the most important thing. We all really appreciate your hard work and how busy it was.\nSee all photos from Christopher C. for Galbi King",

The food quality was fine, but not very flavorful. The only meat I really liked was the short rib. The biggest disappointments were both of the chicken options which didn't take on any of the flavor of their seasoning. They obviously hadn't marinated. The sundubu was good. All that for $26 is gonna be a no from me. Not to be rude, but go elsewhere if you can.",

Found this place thought I'd give it a chance. For starters the meat quality is actually pretty good. I especially loved the beef belly. The sides were average at best not that much variety. I felt the the cucumbers weren't as fermented as long as they should've been. The kimchi was okay. Service was good and they were attentive. Felt a bit pricey for what I was getting but in a jam I could see myself going there again.",

(And for the daring, more parking is across the street at the Rite Aid/Ralph's area)\n\n1 star for:\n- Wait was over an hour at 7pm on a Saturday (but at the same time this is half of how long you wait for in the popular Ktown joints)\n- Bulgogi was cut thickly and not shredded well\n- Pork Belly strips were too thin\n- Not enough short ribs\n\nWe also had to ask for the sesame oil/salt dipping sauce which I think should be standard because it's so good. Also the salad was supposed to be part of the banchan but I think you could ask for it (honestly I gave up because I was already getting full lol). And yes you heard right, I wanted salad because it actually tastes effing amazing when scooped up with the meat.

I found this place to be one of, and the only, closest ayce (all you can eat) Korean BBQ. After craving Korean BBQ, I drove here to find out there was a long line for seating (30+ min.).\n\nFinally, it was my turn but then...I was told that the ayce Korean BBQ requires a minimum of 2 people...never in all my times eating at a restaurant have I heard this discrimination against solo eaters. Why do solo eaters have this difference in experience just because they are not with someone? Based on the busyness, lack of picking up their phone ringing thousands of times, and long wait for seating, I implied that they set this cap so solo eaters are not \"wasting\" their space taking up a table. I can understand this to a point, but since they have the portable grill / burners, if they want to keep the space open for bigger parties, then offer to cook the meat on those. In addition, it was insulting that they place you in the \"hidden\" back and the table is disoriented because it was not part of their usual setup. This is the spot if you eat alone where you feel like you are \"worthless\" as their customer. If you eat alone, we do not care about you. This is food / customer discrimination!\n\nNow, the food itself was not bad but again...HOW CAN I JUDGE WITHOUT HAVING THE MAIN AYCE KOREAN BBQ! The seafood tofu soup was not something I would recommend. It was not bad but it was not average in taste. It tastes like they seasoned it with the Korean ramen packets. The LA galbi was too salty by soy sauce seasoning. However, it was quite thicker than usual which is pleasant for the big portion eaters. But, in terms of quality, I had better even from other ayce Korean BBQ restaurants. Overall, the food was not bad, especially, given the distance compared to Koreatown. Therefore, they get an overall 2 stars in rating for the solo eater discrimination but food being decent raising it by 1 star.\n\nParking is limited depending on the time you visit. They have only a small number of assigned parking to their restaurant vs the other businesses in the plaza. At night, it seems you can park in the majority of the lot given they close later. The interior is a typical Korean BBQ design with wooden tables and booths. The BBQ grill is in the middle of the table.",

                  "review": "1 photo\nThis was my second time here and the experience was much better then the first. The service is average and they do the bare minimum to make sure your experience is good or that you are receiving all that should get as part of your AYCE meal. The meat/food is also average. But let's be real here, what do you expect from an AYCE?  Also, while the meat is decent, it shines when you pair it with the included banchan, the sauces, and soups, etc..:) We had a party of 6, oddly enough, the owner (I assume he is the owner as he was the only Korean guy) was asking all smaller parties how their meal was. He never came by ours, maybe because gratuity was already required for us? Anyways, why the 4 stars with the above mediocre start? It's because if you manage your expectations, are aware of what you are entitled in the AYCE package,  and follow the below tips, you will have much better AYCE experience!  So first, a little about the AYCE itself. As of 12/3/2021, the price is $25.99 for all individuals over 9 years old and if you pay in cash, you get a 5% discount. Note there is an 18% gratuity for all parties of 6 or more. (see screenshot).\nTIP #1: Bring cash if possible to utilize the 5% discount.\n\nTIP #2: Arrive between 5-5:30 pm if possible. Tables will start filling up at 6pm. This means you will receive better service and attention. Service will decline as it gets busier.  It will also be much less chaotic and it will be easier to find parking.\n\nTIP#3 You are allowed a max of 3 types of meat for your first order set. This just means you have to start with 3 meats before you can order the next set of three. It's all subjective, but I recommend the Boneless short rib, Beef Tongue, and spicy squid as your first set.  Then whatever other meat you want to try for your next set. But just make sure you try them all if possible!\n\nTIP#4: Your AYCE meal comes with either Tofu soup/Steam egg bowl. Each person is limited to one. If you like these side dishes, make sure you ask for it as they WILL NOT ask you directly. Additionally, the meal includes a light sesame vinaigrette salad consisting of fine shredded lettuce and carrots. Again, ask for this if you want it with your meal, as they WILL NOT ask you directly. For my group of 6, two bowls of Tofu soup and 2 bowls of steamed egg was plenty! We also got the side salad in addition to the included banchan dishes. It made for a more balanced meal.\n\nTIP#5: Lastly, This is also subjective, but Korean BBQ is so much better with cold beer. Order a 20oz bottle of Sapporo (8 bucks) to share with your friends and family. ENJOY!\nMenu as of 12/3/2021. I recommend the Boneless short Rib, Beef tongue, and Squid as your first set.:)",

Since we were a party of 9, she called ahead to see if it would be possible for us to sit together and they said yes. When we arrived, the man working at the counter did not even give us the time of day. We were trying to put our names down on the list so we could wait outside, but he kept walking away from us when we were talking to him. It was very frustrating. Finally we got on the list and walked outside to wait. We waited for almost 45 minutes before we got seated. While we were waiting, I noticed that they were seating a lot of parties that came after us before they seated us. Also, while we were waiting a family with someone in a wheelchair left and told us that they denied them service because they don't seat people with wheelchairs. I thought that was absolutely ridiculous and very upsetting.\n\nThe meats were just okay. I know that the prices are low, but still I found many of the cuts to be very fatty and hard to eat. Shortly after we were seated and ordered the first round of meat, we were told that they were doing last call and we needed to order the rest of our food. We were very surprised to hear of this since it was so early and they didn't close for another hour and a half. I was annoyed that they rushed us so much.\n\nOverall, I was not happy with my experience at Galbi King. I definitely will not be returning, and I suggest that you stay away as well.",

AYCE (patio dining) is currently $23.99.\n\nI ordered the galbi and soon tofu (soondobu) combo which came out to $19.99 before tax. You can choose between seafood, beef, or both for the stew. Spiciness level is also a choice.\n\nThe banchan are kimchi, Korean pickled cucumbers, potato salad, and eomuk fish cakes. Everything is pretty typical and par the course for banchan.\n\nThe soon tofu tasted good and was packed with spoonable, soft tofu. I got the combination which came with beef, oyster, clam, and shrimp. The meat was mostly clam. Oddly, I had only one shrimp and a fairly small, shell-on one at that. The ratios are pretty badly off but at least it all tastes good.\n\nThe galbi is good and you get 7 slices. This is flanken cut/ LA galbi. Unlike some places where the norm is 3 flanken bones cut thinly, there's one bone per piece and it's thickly cut. Seemingly, most restaurants appear to use the lateral cuts closest to the rip tips, but Galbi King also uses ribs cut closer to the base. Regardless, there's a lot of meat per piece. Very tasty galbi; the marinade is a bit sweeter than other Korean restaurants. The meat lies on a bed of raw onion.\nSee all photos from Brandon C. for Galbi King",

This is ridiculous .. my total was 85 bucks but they guy tipped himself 15 bucks plus the covid tax pay thing .. my total came out to 107 dollars for 3 people ... now  the only reason I mentioned the tip is because they add 15 bucks for there tip and they don't even take care of the guests right I feel our waiter came 2x if that...  we would have to look for him ... don't come here guys parking isn't good .. they tax extra... they add there own tip .... And like I said I'm not greedy I will tip but for you not to check on our table at all ... other than the 2x WE CALLED you .. never again",

With two teenage boys we opted for the AYCE.  Service was prompt, extra sides and rice was provided.  I did not care for the pork belly but the bulgogi and short ribs were the best.  We also had the tongue which I found not as tasty but it was fine with the sauces. Last meat we ordered was the brisket which was good. We wanted to try the squid but we were too full at that point. It was great food and they do offer a cash discount.  Still for $133 for four people you cannot go wrong.  Will go back but not a place I would go to monthly.  A fun experience.

They actually have a very extensive menu of authentic Korean soups and noodles. The soondooboo is good, the jap chae is delicious, and the naeng myun is great too! I love that they package all the side dishes in generous portions when you order to-go.\nIf you're too lazy to drive to Koreatown, this is a good alternative. Pricing is also pretty affordable, and there's easy parking in the lot. During COVID, they've been able to set up a couple small outdoor tables and are still serving KBBQ (if you want to do that). Otherwise, takeout is a great option to keep supporting this business!",

That's not how AYCE works. Second of all it's like $27 and the list isn't even big at all. Third of all make sure u do not tip it's already included in the bill and funny part is they don't tell you unless you ask so make sure you double check everything.",

My husband and I came here today and there are a few reasons why my rating is lower than I would have liked. When we came this morning there was only one other family sitting at a table. We were greeted by a nice waiter, I didn't get his name. He sat us down and turned on the grill. He didn't explain anything to us. The menu they had was frayed and pasted to the wall of our booth. When we started ordering he then tells us we can only order 3 items. We paid for All you can eat so it would have been nice to tell us the rules. Nowhere was it posted that we could only order 3 items. It was no biggie. We ordered teriyaki chicken, spicy chicken and beef bolgi. The waiter turned the fire on so high the fire kept flaring up. He didn't check with us and every time I flagged him down he was so busy. I ended up having to sit closer to the aisle so I wouldn't get singed by the fire. During this time more people started showing up. So I'm thinking okay there has to be another waiter coming to help because this place is packed. Nope. No one came to help this poor guy. I had to flag him down 4 times to fill up our waters. The food wasn't bad but I won't return until they hire more people. This poor guy did not deserve to be running back and forth between families by himself with no break.",

They insisted we sit in ONE booth.\nThere was no room to eat, much less set the platters with the meat we were cooking.\n\nI didn't really eat. My space was the one that had the meat to be cooked- so I chatted, laughed and visited with family while I cooked. It was important that all others enjoyed themselves.  It's just too bad I wasn't able to do so.\nI ate a sandwich after getting home.\n\nTip: don't go here if your party is more than 6 people.  The big booths are for 6 adults, not more.\nIf you do have more-- register yourself at the front as two separate parties, so you get two tables. Perhaps you are fortunate to sit close to each other.",

This place is small and a bit tight if you're here with a big group.  The service isn't that great. Just getting a napkin requires you to hail down several people.  \n\nThe meat is not of good quality and there is a lot of fat on the meat. If you're not picky about your meat and just want to try Korean bbq go for it. The meat is tasty and has lots of flavor but again it's of poor quality.\n\nYou cook your own food so you get to decide how much you want to cook your meat. Also if you choose the all you can eat option, again, it's going to be hard getting your server to come back to your table so just keep that in mind. You also can't stay at your table for an unlimited time. FYI.\nSee all photos from Nina K. for Galbi King",

This restaurant is just okay--not the worst that I've had, but definitely not the best. Whether you're ordering Korean BBQ or tofu soup, they don't use high quality meats. It's not the freshest either. At least, the flavor is there. Prices have raised, most likely due to COVID. All you can eat is now $23.99. On the plus side, there's plenty of free parking available and they accept credit cards.",

Actually quick service for KBBQ. Deserves more stars.\n\nAMBIENCE: Okay, I don't really get why Galbi King is only 3 stars. It honestly deterred me at first, but it shouldn't have and you shouldn't be deterred either if you're looking for KBBQ and you just so happen to be in West LA and don't want to fight an hour of traffic to go to K-town. This is the only AYCE KBBQ place on the west side!!!! It's a clean KBBQ restaurant with many tables with their own grills. It's normally smoky for a KBBQ place, and this follows suit. It is normal to expect that you will leave smelling like KBBQ. That's part of it.\n\nSERVICE: Good! Good for KBBQ. Usually service is not great and you have to wait a long time for people to get you more rounds of meat, but the waiters came up and asked us. They also changed your grill when you asked.\n\nFOOD: There's banchan, there's steamed egg, there's tofu soup, and a large selection of different meats! We didn't even try all of them.\n\nThe meat is not the HIGHEST quality, but it is normal and on par with other KBBQ places in this price range. It's not less worth it because it's on the west side or anything.\n\nOverall, this place definitely deserves better than its Yelp rating. Maybe people who rated it don't typically get KBBQ? Location alone, it's convenient!!! I would go here if I'm craving KBBQ and I'm stuck on the west side.\n\nTip: Pay in cash to get a discount!",

I rarely ever finish the banchan but totally did this time! The galbi + soon tofu combo was $20 which I thought was super reasonable. I called ahead to place my order and it was ready for pick-up in less than 20 minutes. Highly recommend ordering here if you're needing your galbi fix. Despite it being takeout, you won't feel like you're missing out on anything!",

Honestly one of the best I've ever tried and you can adjust the spice level. Price is also pretty good for what you get.\n\nGalbi King is open during COVID-19 era. They have set up tables outside and it feels completely safe. The tables are spread far away from one another and the staff all wear masks.",

Sides out very quickly and round 1 of ordering meat began shortly. Sides were delicious. My favorites include the noodles, mashed potatoes, fish pancakes. Everything else was good too though the rice paper was a little too thick for my liking.",

Like other reviews mention, it's the only AYCE kbbq in our area. Quite frankly I work in Ktown and am surrounded by awesome kbbq options and when I come home the last thing I want to do is drive 45 min./1hr in rush hour back to Ktown.\n\nNow to review the food.\n\nMy bf and I came at around 5:15pm and they open at 5pm. We were the third party seated. By 6pm the place is halfway full. We got brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, and spicy squid along with spicy tofu soup. All in all it was good, average food. My favorite was the spicy tofu soup--creamy with just enough spice and I love spicy (it's a spicy kick I can keep eating without a break).\n\nAfter eating here with my bf he and I agree it's worth the extra $10 and worth the drive to eat at a more quality kbbq resturaunt in ktown. This place is good for value and quantity, but sadly I think quality is average at best.\n\n10% off your bill if you pay in cash.\n\nService was good.\n\nParking is plentiful in the lot shared with Chase bank and other boutique stores granted it's not a busy night.  Otherwise street parking is the next resort.\nSides\nMenu December 2019",

When we got there, there were quite a few people there, but we were seated immediately. We were seated at a booth and our host immediately turned on the stove. It didn't take long for us to decide what meat we wanted. We ended up getting the following:\n\n- 3 tofu soups (not part of the all you can eat)\n- 2 rice\n- fried dumplings (not part of the all you can eat)\n- bibambap\n- brisket\n- boneless short ribs\n- pork belly\n\nFirst they brought out the sides; they gave us a good amount. Then the soup and the bibambap. Not a huge fan of those two, but my friends enjoyed out. After cam the meat and holyyyy cow they give big platters. To be honest, we didn't order any other meat after that. Well, no, my friend ordered a small plate of cow tongue for herself, but yeah, anyways.\n\nThe food was delicious and worth every penny. The service was great. They were attentive -- they replaced our grill quite often, which was awesome. Food was good and cheap (good size portions) and the service was great. What more can you ask for? Honestly, I wouldn't mind going back. It was worth it.\n\nAlso, as a side tip -- you have a two hour time limit. But, if you were hungry like us, you'll be in and out with min the hour!",

We left about an hour and a half later and saw a small wait outside.\n\nThere is a little lot to park in just behind the place but there are so many signs about where you can park and not park so it was kind of confusing in the sense that there was like 2 spots for Galbi King that was assigned which didnt make sense for a restaurant. I guess it was more weird than confusing.\n\nWe had the Brisket, Teriyaki Chicken, Pork Belly, Beef Tongue, Tofu soup and Steamed Egg. It was all pretty delicious. Mix the tofu soup and steamed egg together and it's amazing. They have a good selection of ban chan too. The grill does get dirty quickly so you need to ask them to change it or the meat doesn't cook right. They were attentive and got us our food quickly and checked in on us. I'd love to come back and try some of the other stuff like the squid and other dishes... my friends weren't that adventurous.",

If anyone knows any other KBBQ out here, please PM me.\n\nWe got the brisket (thin and stuck to the grill), tongue (loved this - they do not skimp), bulgogi, squid, short ribs (yums), the steamed egg, and bibimbop.  The banchan is pretty standard - not the most flavorful, but I'll eat it - maybe I should ask for some sauce for it.\n\nIt is worth it for me, so I'm giving it 4 stars.",

Every time I passed by this place, I wanted to come back at some point. I regret that decision.\nI came here tonight with my best friend for AYCE. It took about 20 minutes or so to get seated. They sat us in the booth all the way around the corner in the very back.\nThe server came and took our meat order, and my best friend put in an order for tofu soup, and we put in orders for two bowls of rice. They brought the tofu soup with no spoon, all the little side dishes, and apparently they have no radish. Whatever, I ate the meat with the rice.\nI ran out of rice rather quickly, and I asked the guy who changed our grill if he could please bring me another bowl. He didn't return for 15 minutes and without the rice. He came back to do a grill change. When he came for that, I asked again for another bowl of rice and more of the spicy sauce. My best friend asked for a spoon, but then inquired about the level of spiciness of the tofu soup. She cannot eat spicy things, so we weren't sure why they brought out incredibly spicy tofu soup. You could tell it was extremely spicy based on the colour. The guy confirmed our suspicions, and she said she not only didn't ask for it to be spicy, but nowhere on the menu does it say that the soup is spicy. The guy, instead of apologising, and saying he would talk to the person who took our order, said \"well, normally we ask what level of spiciness you would like for your soup\" to which I replied \"well, he didn't.\" We just asked him to take back the soup because she no longer wanted it. When he brought back the rice and sauce for me, he threw them down and left. When he came back again he said, in a rather snarky way, \"did I bring you everything you asked for?\" Yeah you did, after what felt like forever!\nThey never even brought us more sides when we ran out!\nHonestly, I don't need snark from anyone to that degree, therefore will not be returning. Sticking to Shik do Rak in GG!\nAYCE menu - where does it mention that the tofu soup CAN be spicy?\nBeef brisket",

The food is honestly amazing and the folks that work there are totally friendly and helpful.

They offer beef brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, beef belly, short ribs, beef tongue, and chicken. And, although they give a lot of varieties, the quality doesn't really match the price : / beef belly and brisket were pretty good! Tender and juicy. However, the short ribs felt a little chewy. They do also offer tofu soup and bibimbap with the AYCE menu. Service was okie! They were a little slow, but I did like that they changed the grill often. This is the only KBBQ place that I know that is around UCLA and Sawtelle, so it's convenient in that way. Other than that, this place is average. Very limited parking in their structure!",

Wait was about 10 minutes.\n\nSuch a big bummer that their brisket sauce was sweeter than usual. I'm used to a little more tart. Meat wasn't the best quality, but we ordered the brisket, beef tongue, and beef bulgogi. Servings were huge at the beginning which was a plus. But I think it was also because they were so short on staff that they brought out the meat in huge quantities.\n\nService was good. Fast and courteous. I would come back if I wanted a quick eat, but I've seen and had better. Even with just a change in brisket sauce recipe would be bomb and make this place better.",

It can get packed, especially Fridays and Saturdays, so try to get there early or prepare to wait around 20-30 minutes.\n\nIt's super casual so no need to dress up -- in fact, prepare for whatever clothes you are wearing, and your hair, to smell like Korean bbq forever. You can opt for either a table with a grill to cook your own meat or a \"regular\" table where all you need to do is sit back, sip a beer and/or some sake, and wait for your food to arrive. Their banchan are pretty good -- my kids always ask for extra cucumbers, which means more kimchi for me.\n\nI usually order the seafood tofu soup (medium spicy -- I love spicy food but the spicy version ends up making me sweat like a sinner in church) or the bibimbap -- both delicious. My kids love both the galbi and bulgogi. In fact, my 7 yo can eat several plates of their meat.\n\nOverall, we love this place because the quality of the food is consistent and we can show up in sweats and a baseball cap and not feel guilty or judged.",

Luckily I didn't get sick, but then again I didn't eat any more after I tasted the first piece. The short rib wasn't bad, so I filled up on that. The kimchi was subpar also. When we ordered soup, they would only give us ONE small bowl and made us split it (there were 6 of us!) before they would give us another bowl!\n\nSo, if you'd like horrible service on top of the horrible food, please come here.\nForced us to split this tiny little bowl between 6 people.

Second, he just dunk the whole meat in the grilled without saying \"excuse me\". Third, he just put the other meat on the sides which where my cousin's water was in, if my cousin didn't move her water it would have been spilled. Lastly, he stepped on my friend's shows and spilled a little sauce on it and just walk away not even saying sorry. Take note my friend's feet was under the table. And the bad part was we can't even choose how much tip we put in. They already put a $31 for a tip. Yes i would gladly give that if they were good and nice but not on what we have dealt.

It took a long time to even get addressed, that's not good customer service. The server was the same person seating people, waiting on all tables, and he was the bus boy. The guy was working hard no doubt. They need more servers. The server did not have the greatest customer service skills but I do admit that he was hustling. We had to ask for our sides more than once. The server never came to our table to check up on us and it wasn't easy getting his attention. The service at this place is awful. The food is not great, the meat did not look fresh. A few of the people in my party had a stomach ache after we ate here. I do not recommend this place.",

I come here alllll the time, service and portions are terrific.\n\nWe always get the brisket, and short rib but honestly what sets this place apart from the rest is it's incredible tofu soup (soondobu). It's sooooo thick and creamy and we only get the medium spice level but that's more than enough for us.\n\nWhen the wait time for dinner is too long, we often do ala carte and leave super full.\n\nHighly recommend this place for anyone not willing to trek to ktown. Come early to avoid the dinner rush.\nUseful 2\nFunny\nCool 1",

I liked the steamed egg, chicken was decent, pork belly was decent, short rib was decent, the brisket was not good (brisket is usually my favorite). The spicy pork comes cooked, which is fine and that was ok. Overall an ok experience. Lots of oil splattering so beware of that. It's not a bad place to go on the westside since it's so easy to get there, but not so easy to park. Really, it's fine and I think that if you live on the westside, you'll probably go since it's relatively convenient and decent. Just know what to order and what to avoid and you'll be fine. It's really a 3 star experience. There was a short wait when we arrived on a Saturday night, but a much longer wait when we left at 8pm so beware of that.",

As for selection on meats and sides, they have the basics of what you can expect from KBBQ. I usually don't see bibimbap as a side, but that came with the AYCE option. It was not on a stone pot.

The bonus you get here is that bibimbop is included in the AYCE.\n\nIm older and wiser now, so when I go for KBBQ I'm mindful of the after effects of eating low quality and heavily salted meats, so I go for the all around experience and not to just stuff my face with endless amounts of meat. That said, the meat quality and side here aren't the best. But it's $20 AYCE.\n\nSides (banchan):\nAre a key factor in the overall taste experience.  The side dishes here aren't the best. They are missing a lot of the favorites and the kimchi was just okay.\n- fish cake strips, kimchi, bean sprouts, and potato salad. I had to ask for salad as well (just shredded cabbage in a light sauce).\n- they used to have the kimchi cucumber and kimchi radish, but not anymore.\n- make sure to ask for soy paper and sesame oil as they don't bring this out either.\n\nThe meats are also fairly limited:\n- Beef belly (fatty beef) gotta have it. Thinly sliced fatty beef. Super flavorful.\n- Brisket always a good call, but on the fatty side here. Very thin cut. Unmarinated. Almost seemed like they just brought out beef belly again.\n- Short Rib (a must) good but again very fatty pieces.  Marinated well, thick cuts, has a sweet taste.\n- Bulgogi this was a huge miss for us. Stringy, low quality cuts, very sweet (too sweet) marinade. I generally like bulgogi but something must've been tonight. We actually sent it back so as not to waste precious space in stomach and ordered more short rib.\n- Spicy pork is verrry salty here. It's good but only in moderation... and makes a mess of the grill. Make sure to get a grill change after.\n\nExtras:\n- Bibimbop (do it!) some might say this is filler, to which I say \"you are filler\". Put a nice helping of gochujan sauce, throw some brisket and short rib in there, and you're good to go... oh and don't forget the steamed egg.\n- steamed egg - I like it, but not everyone will. It's just a steamed egg mix, lol. Has a soft flan like consistency. Feel free to pass.\n\nService:\nYou have to be aggressive here as they don't check on you that often. Which is standard for kbbq... only they don't have a button. One plus is there is a person cruising just eyeing all the grills and they change em quick when all the sugar from the marinades start to burn on.\n\nOverall, it's very average AYCE. Gets the job done if you don't want to go to K-Town, the valley, or pay for higher quality non AYCE.",

The place is quite small and I wouldn't take a large group to eat here. The interesting thing is that this place also serves tortilla and they have salsa as one of the main sauces. This is not your typical Korean barbecue place. Also when they were serving the meat, there was one plate that had mixed meats in it which is a no-no when you're serving raw uncooked meat to people. This place also has a very limited options so if you want to have more options don't go to this place. It's not a bad place to eat but it's also not the greatest. If you're on a budget this might be a good place to go but I would spend a little more to find a better place to eat.",

My friends and I were set on eating here, and the wait gave us lots of time to get our stomachs prepped for the meal that awaited us.\n\nAs we sat down, we immediately ordered and the meat and sides came within minutes. For the next two hours, my friends and I ate until our stomachs couldn't fit anymore. The meat was quality, and all of the sides complimented the main course really well. They give free rice at this place which apparently is uncommon, and it's a simple yet great compliment to the fantastic meal prepared right in front of your eyes.\n\nThe meal was $20 per person. They calculate around 15% within your check, but the service was so great that we tipped extra. Overall, it was great food and a cool experience that I will definitely do again.\n\nTip - if this is your first time, go with someone more experienced. It saves you the hassle of preparing your meat and ordering off the menu. Plus there's someone to explain all the dishes. My only job was to relax and stuff myself to the fullest capacity.",

They have $20 AYCE with a decently large menu to choose from. Unfortunately the meats don't always taste completely fresh, especially the marinated ones. Sometimes the color of the meat is brownish which makes me think it's been sitting out for a while. Luckily my favorite meat, the beef tongue, has been fresh here and is served plain/un-marinated. Their steamed eggs and tofu soup are a nice compliment to all the greasy meat. This place is \"A-ok\" and I would only come out of convenience!",

The waiters always seem annoyed and there are only two. The bus boy who also acted as a waiter was amazing. If they hire more staff like him to wait tables I'm sure they'd get a lot more business. The quality of the meat is bleh. The tongue was very chewy last night which I'm not used to... the spicy pork bulgogi comes cooked already... i didn't like it. My favs were the brisket and beef belles because they were very tender and unseasoned. The spicy squid was also pretty tasty. This place is like a 10 minute drive from be but Because the service has been so crappy I think I would rather drive to ktown.\nMenu only 1 page",

Actually, pretty much the only place, which I assume is why they fall short on some places, though that's not to say it's not a good spot to stop if you want kbbq and you don't have the time/patience for a trip to k-town!\n\nThe meat is served in HUGE portions, no matter the party size, which is a bit discouraging if you want to try a lot of different things; definitely not the place for that, more like if you know what you want! Quality is pretty good, nothing to complain about, and the seasoning on the marinated meats are fine. Honestly, you can't really beat the price/quality ratio at this place.\n\nSide dishes included are fish cake strips, bean sprouts, kimchi (traditional and cucumber), glass noodles, and potato salad. They're all standard and compliment the meal well. I really like the different soups that come with the AYCE menu, especially the tofu soup. It's irritating that some of the employees include soup orders as a single item, especially if there's a big group because then only one or two people can get soup in order to not limit the number of meats you can order at once, though some others are more reasonable about it. Service overall is pretty meh, but nothing so horrible that I'd stop going.\n\nMust tries of the meat cuts are beef belly, pork belly, spicy chicken (don't over cook it! Cut it into pieces so you can feel safe about consumption!) and spicy squid. The beef tongue is a bit of a let down, but if you're comfortable having it very rare it works. Overall, a totally okay spot if you're really in the mood for KBBQ.",

I was really surprised that they had beef tongue, which was a personal favorite! They also serve lots of different banchan dishes including the glass noodle jap chae and fish cakes. I also liked how they had seafood tofu soup because some places don't have that option. I went with a big group of 8 but we only had one grill, which made it somewhat difficult to share. Overall, I felt the quality of the meat didn't quite match up to the price, but you also don't have many kbbq options in west LA. Paying with cash gives you a 5% discount! There is a parking lot in the back but be sure to look at the signs because some spots are specifically reserved for other stores at certain times.

This place has a wide variety of items on their menu and AYCE KBBQ. Why did I not know of this place while I was attending UCLA?! For around $20, AYCE with bibimbap and banchan, etc. is well worth not having to drive to Ktown in rush hour traffic.\n\nThey also serve drinks and regular meals if you would like to opt out of the KBBQ experience. They're usually busiest at nights on weekends, so prepare for that!\n\nMy biggest disappointment would probably just be that the side dishes don't taste as great, even though there are a handful to choose from. They look like they've been left out or just not as fresh. Their naengmyun galbi combo is very worth the price!\nNaengmyun galbi combo for only $13 more or less. Great deal and is super filling!

For $20pp, it's not a bad deal and there are a decent amount of parking in the lot after all the other businesses have closed for the day.\n\nExpect to wait for dinner, since this place is pretty small. I waited about 15-20 minutes for a party of three on a Thursday night. But I believe you can make reservation for a large party.\n\nThey give a decent assortment of banchan with your meal. But overall quality for everything is just OK. We ordered plates of bulgogi, brisket, pork belly, and short ribs. The bulgogi was a lot sweeter than I expected compared to other kbbq places. The pork belly are the thinly sliced pieces and majority were mainly just fat. The short ribs were pretty good, but overly chewy. It satisfied the craving, but just that. The upside is that they will give you a lot and you order your dishes. So order half size plates if just want a taste of everything.\n\nService will not be that good here, given they only have two waiters and a host servicing the entire restaurant. It is extremely difficult to get their attention throughout your meal. Your best bet is to place a good portion of your dishes when you first sit down.\n\nGiven I have to drive over an hour to get to ktown, I will probably come here more often than not avoid traffic.",

                  "review": "1 photo\nNot looking to make the drive out to Koreatown from the Westside for AYCE KBBQ? Galbi King can save you the trip out there. $20 for AYCE and not driving to Ktown??? Not a bad deal. Service was excellent as well!!\n\nFirst off, the side dishes were awesome. I think this might've been the first time I've had spicy fish cake. I had no problem asking for multiple refills on the side dishes so indulge!! The Korean Bean Paste soup and Tofu Soup were also better than I anticipated since this is a KBBQ spot. The soups were rich with flavor and not diluted like most KBBQ places. There weren't watery at all. Also a plus for me was the unlimited race paper!!!! It's even on the menu as an item for AYCE. 2 thumbs up for that one!\n\nMy favorite meats were the marinated short rib, beef tongue and beef belly. All were tasty! If I would've known better, I wouldn't have ordered the beef brisket at all. Usually I always start out with an order of brisket but this place literally gives you MASSIVE amounts of brisket to start with...This might be a strategic ploy to fill you up with the cheap meats before you get to the good meats...So if you're ordering beef brisket first, I'd suggest asking for very little of it or not ordering it at all.\n\nSome side points:\n\n1) I wouldn't order the spicy pork bulgogi. It came out pre-cooked so we didn't get the chance to cook it ourselves. And the way they marinated/cooked it, it came out pretty soggy.\n2) They seemed to only give us 2 meats at a time even when we told our server 3 different types of meat. This happened multiple times...\n\nIn sum, I'd come back to this place if I didn't feel like making the trip out to Ktown!",

That was nice, especially for coming at a pretty average dinner time.\n\nMeat was alright. Have to say that their beef tongue is really good and would definitely recommend! Other meats were pretty average quality. Not amazing, but not terrible either. Also liked most of their side dishes, but the kimchi was a bit too sour, in my opinion.\n\nThe store seemed really understaffed the day we went in. There were two workers that were running around filling requests and taking orders. Because of this, a lot of things we asked for were forgotten and never brought to us. I felt bad for the two workers and hope they really hire some more people because they seemed very stressed.\n\nAlso, they serve water from a bucket? I saw them get water from a bucket to fill people's cups. It seemed that the bucket was clean, but it was a little bit concerning.\n\nAlso, there is parking in the back.",

It's a Wednesday night. I got there around 7:30 pm. It wasn't too many customers inside the restaurant. We had all you can eat bbq like we always get. After we finished, we paid by credit card. THEY DIDN'T ASK US IF WE WANT TO ADD TIPS INTO CREDIT CARD. THEY DIDN'T ASK US HOW MANY PERCENTAGE WE WANT TO ADD AS TIPS. THEY JUST ADD TIPS $ WHAT THEY WANT INTO CREDIT CARD WITHOUT ANY NOTICE. We were only 2 people, not a big party. They forced us to pay certain percentage tips. That's really ridiculous.

The service is not great, but if you come on a weekday the service tends to be a lot better.  \n\nNow let's talk about what we are all thinking, what about the meat?  One of the reasons why I have been here multiple times is because of their beef tongue.  It is one of their better meats on the menu.  Other items I tend to stick to when I come here include the boneless short ribs, beef brisket, pork belly, and bulgogi.  FYI, the pork belly is cut very thin.\n\nTheir side dishes include fish cake, potato salad, kimchi, bean sprouts, and a salad. Don't forget to order a steamed egg and tofu soup, as they are good to have on the table while the meat is cooking.\nBoneless short ribs on the left and beef tongue on the right\nBrisket on the left and Pork Belly on the right",

My boyfriend lives over in sawtelle so he recommended this place, so we both went after a day of festivities.\n\nWe got to the restaurant at about 9:00 p.m and there was about 4 parties seated. We signed our name and in about 5 minutes, we were called in to be seated. They have two options for dine-in, either AYCE or just regular. We opted for AYCE. Once we sat down, fire was placed on our grill and they brought us two waters. They have a menu on the wall. It's nice and simple, so a good place to satisfy cravings if you don't want too many choices.\n\nIt's 19.95 a person, so not the cheapest kbbq out there, but normal pricing for dinner. As for all kbbq, and most Korean places, they bring you side dishes (kimchi, potatoe Salad, fish cakes, etc).\n\nWe ordered bulgogi, and brisket along with short ribs. Either their portions are real big or I wasn't feeling the food because after one round I was already super bloated. The food taste itself is mediocre. We also got a seafood soup which was pretty good. Not overpowering in taste.\n\nService wise, there were only two servers so they were constantly running around serving guest, but even with the low numbers, they were quick with their service. So plus one for service.\n\nOverall, I probably wouldn't come back unless I was in the area. I definitely prefer GEN for the price and quality/quantity.",

                  "review": "7 photos\nMy buddy Walt and I have a problem: we're both unable to deny the other person's suggestion of ordering a particular item when we're at AYCE restaurants. This \"laissez-faire\" attitude usually ends up with us trying to force down a few extra plates of food like competitors near the conclusion of a eating contest; both of us mashing up food and washing it down with beer while tears stream down our faces. And all that just to consume enough food so the amount of food we DO leave doesn't seem obscene.\n\nIncredibly, this didn't happen (as badly) at Galbi King.* The reason for this will be apparent soon enough but let's address the elephant in the room, which is the service.\n\nSERVICE: Whoa, based on some of the reviews, I was expecting to be ignored by the waitstaff until we were in our own personal, mental hell and then waterboarded for the sole purpose of their amusement. Instead, we were seated quickly, had our first set of meats (brisket, boneless kalbi, bulgogi, and spicy squid)* delivered quickly, and asked at least 2 or 3 times if we wanted more meat. They even changed the grill several times promptly (once without us even needing to ask). And yes, they had almost every table full when we went on a Wednesday night at 7:30pm. The only thing I noticed was that they didn't refill the one banchan we finished or clear a plate that clearly was just sitting there.\n\nFOOD: I'm not a huge fan of marinated meat, but I'll admit that I liked how their marinade is not overly sweet (especially because my existence is one mostly devoid of rice so anything beyond \"lightly\" sweetened/salted leaves in a quandary as to with what I can accompany it). The brisket was great and I would have asked for a second order except I wanted to try the pork belly (which was less fatty and therefore tougher than I would have liked). Their squid was excellent; firm and flavored well with their own sauce.\n\nAMBIANCE: They need to seriously upgrade their exhaust system because the current one is inadequate; way too much smoke remain in the restaurant, which results in the accumulation of grease on the walls and other surfaces.  Not exactly a place where you'd go for the first, oh, few dates?\n\nWe're gonna be back, and next time we'll bring some other friends so we'll be able to try more items with a full booth of 4. Hopefully they won't just wholesale agree to whatever random menu items Walt and I suggest. Otherwise it'll get ugly real quick.\n\n* [Yep, this footnote is referenced twice.] Their policy is to allow an initial order of 3 item but they let us slide with 4. They are nothing if not generous with their portions and one look at the initial order scared us from ordering anything until we were close to finishing it.\nSee all photos from George T. for Galbi King",

My favorite is the marinated beef ribs. The other things that I liked is the bulgogi, spicy chicken, and brisket (best kbbq brisket I've had).\n\nAdditionally, their side dishes all taste great. They include: glass noodles, kimchi, potato salad, salad, bean sprouts, rice cakes, marinated cucumbers, tofu soup (get it with beef! Really good!), steamed rice, and even bibimbop!!\n\nPros: Free parking in their lot!\n\nCons: they bring out each meat one at a time, and bring a huge plate of it. If your party is small, I would suggest that you tell them to bring small amounts of each type of meat at the same time. Or else, they will bring you a huge plate of their cheapest meat first (usually the brisket) and then the expensive short ribs last.\n\n-1 star because the price recently increased from around $17 to $20. They should make different AYCE levels like other kbbq places with different price points, because the sudden price increase for the same menu items sucks!\nShort rib and bulgogi",

It's become one of our regular dinner spots when the Mrs. and I go out. If you've always been driving to K-Town or Mid-City for Korean BBQ, Galbi King gives you a great option that can save you from an hour in the car.\n\nAll you can eat is about $17/person, which is really the only thing you should get here for value purposes. It's legitimately challenging to make it any further than the first round of food that comes out (I've done it twice).\n\nYou get a choice of meats, a moderate selection of banchan, bimbimbap (just ask for it, lots of times people are full before it comes out), and a stone pot egg (also ask for it). If you're hungry, it's a pretty good deal for some pretty decent food.\n\nIt's not the best quality of meat in the world, nor are the flavors particularly authentic like the ahjumas made at your church, but it's totally decent for the price and location on the Westside. It's not fancy. It's not really a date spot, but if your girlfriend likes to eat, she'll appreciate it.\n\nIt gets really busy on weekend nights (like hour+ waits), but Sunday lunches are quick and easy to get a seat. It's not 4 stars like a K-Town BBQ spot would be, but it's 4 stars for convenience on the Westside and eating for volume.\n\nAnd the servers speak English. If you're ever intimidated going to K-Town because you don't speak the hangookmal, your English is more than welcome here.",

But there is a niche that Galbi King serves - cheap ayce kbbq with average cuts. Ayce is $20 here. I would highly recommend the short rib and brisket and pretty much skip all else. The pork belly and spicy pork bugogi are meh at best. They do a good job of refilling water and changing the grill. They'll bring out more banchan if you ask as well. Overall, if you are lazy around west la and ok for decent value, Galbi is the place to go.",

We were seated directly in front of the kitchen which is totally exposed so you can hear all the noise and dishes clanking around. We asked (very politely) if we could wait for a different table and could tell that we were being regarded as difficult. Most of the employees we interacted with were unfriendly and seemed generally bothered by us. By no means am I implying that race has anything to do with it, but because I did not get any of the names of anyone who served us (it seemed to be a team effort, no designated server), all I can say is the two Latino guys were warm and welcoming while everyone else treated us like we were bothering them every time we needed something.\n\nThe food was good. I'd only had Korean BBQ once in the past, years ago, so I don't have much to compare. The options that were not marinated or salted and ended up tasting bland and I'm not sure if that's how it's normally done or if we should have done something differently to give them more flavor. We tried them with various sides, made little wraps, etc. No guidance was given so I guess you're just supposed to figure it out if you're unfamiliar with Korean food.\n\nI would love to have Korean BBQ again but not sure if I would choose this restaurant next time.",

So your service is poor because that's what you do? Lol! Wow!\n\nNow, the food...\nSo three of us have been experiencing abdominal pain and cramps and...well, the runs! TMI?

So back to the stomach aches...when I was a server @ a sushi place, I had experienced a rude patron and a regular patron approached me afterwards saying that I should put eye drops in someone's water if they were being a jerk! I never did, of course...but we might've experienced this, especially because we were talking about how rude that server with the hat was and he was within earshot.\n\nAnyway, I don't think we'll ever come back here.\nI might open our own Kbbq in that area, someday...so be on the lookout!",

All the reviews don't lie.\n\nI was there yesterday right before rush hour and ordered some brisket, kalbi, & beer. I'm not sure if it's all you can eat there but my friend ordered all of that and there was a bowl of bim bop that came with our order.\n\nThe service was horrible and the brisket was so low quality without much marbling, and when you cook it all the way to try to drain the fat it just curled up like plastic.\n\nMy friend knows that KBBQ with beer makes me the happiest girl in the world which is why we have been doing so much KBBQ for the past month all over Ktown so we've got it all down by now. Unfortunately he doesn't Yelp and this was the closest place we could meet after my meeting so we tried it, thinking Yelpers could be wrong, but never again will I distrust a low Yelp rating.\n\nBanchan lacked any real robust Korean flavor. Kim Chi didn't have any kick and other banchan was soft and soggy especially the zucchini.\n\nWe were just having a good time talking and as the place got busier we kept trying to wave the waiter down for beers and he kept passing right by us.\n\nWe sat there just enjoying our time while continuing with more beers and the waiter comes by and leaves the check. After a few more times passing us by and not even paying attention or asking if we need anything else, he stops dead in his tracks, sees our bowl of bim bop and demands an answer as to why we didn't touch it. When we said we were full, he shook his head in disgust and walked away.  After a few more minutes, he comes by again and tells us that we have to hurry and leave because they have people waiting. WTH\n\nIf I would have thought ahead of time I would've told my friend not to tip him because he was such an ass. So we left and went bar hopping down the street in Venice to ease our sorrows.",

I went to Galbi King once before and really enjoyed my soon dubu (tofu soup) but this time it seemed like it didn't have any flavor.  I ordered it medium  and it was an ok spice level, just not very flavorful.  That's ok - I'll give them another shot on this one because I remember really liking it the first time and there are lots of other reasons to come back.  \n\nThey do both AYCE (All You Can Eat) and regular menu items.  If they are crowdedIf you get the all you can eat for $16.99, you get unlimited soon dubu tofu soup (smaller size, beef, seafood, or mixed flavors)\n\nThe beef short rib  and bulgogi were super tender and delicious.  I tend to prefer the marinated meats as they have more flavor. We also got the pork belly and the brisket.  \n\nInsider tip:  if you want to try just a little of something, ask for a small plate of it, or a half-order.",

The servers and hosts always seem to be busting their butt trying to stay on top of the constant need for things and it's nearly impossible to get their attention because of their insane work load, making the experience here become increasingly frustrating. Two people servicing an entire full restaurant and a line out the door every time seems overkill on the employees. The owner needs to hire more people to create a better environment for both the customer and the employee.\n\nAs far as food wise, honestly it's about average quality of food. Meats are decent... but I have one question...\nWho puts apple in their potato salad? Am I the only one that finds this a bit odd?",

They're really consistent with their quality and service.\n\nGalbi - NO BONES. I hate tearing off morsels of meat off the bone and having the sinews stuck between my teeth and having crunchy bits of bone chip my teeth at bad restaurants. Galbi King's galbi comes without the bone, marbled, and succulent.\nBlack Pork Belly - thin, crispy, dip in ssamjang.\nBrisket - simply delicious cooked slightly burnt.\nSoondobu - flavorful broth, soft tofu, comforting.\n\nAlthough Galbi King doesn't have an impressive variety, their galbi and brisket stand out in quality and convenient cuts. I think they can work on their bulgogi and soy bean paste soup though. The banchan are all solid - cucumbers are vinegary, and potato salad is smooth.\n\n$20 per person AYCE.\nThere's adequate parking in the back lot.\nShort wait times on weekdays, expect to wait half an hour on weekends.\nThe service staff is kind and attentive, on weekdays.\nThe grills are unevenly heated, no surprise here.\nIn summary, this is a solid experience for avoiding Ktown and getting boneless galbi.\nGalbi King perfects the galbi by removing the bones.",

They may not measure up to some of the K-Town establishments,  but for being so close and cheap,   We would rather skip the traffic  and super long wait.  The meat and side dishes are always fresh.  I can't speak for the whole menu,  but,  the Kalbi and Bulgogi are always good. So much meat is given on the first plate that we can barely finish it.  And for the funny guy in the other comment,  the Angus Beef Brisket is NOT marinated.  So if you don't dip it in sauce,  it WILL be bland.  Maybe next time bring a salt and pepper shaker.  The only negatives are the lack ventilation and the lack of parking space.",

Their bulgogi meat tastes amazing and their tofu soup is flavorful.\n\nThe service could be a bit better. I have gone at different times and whether it's rush hour or not, the service has been the same. I have to wave down the people to let them know I need something. There is no real interaction after they take an order and serve it to you. There used to be an older Hispanic guy that was really nice and would also be kind enough to change the grill for us and refill our water. I haven't seen him in a while, though.\n\nIf you want to come for dinner, I recommend you get to the place at 5:30. That is when they reopen after lunch. There is no wait and you can get seated at the tables right away which is a plus if you are going for All You Can Eat.",

I had it on my list for a while, because it's only about three blocks away from my apartment, and I wish I hadn't ultimately bothered.\n\nTheir basic $20 AYCE configuration may be a quantity-over-quality play, but even that is spoiled by being attended to so poorly. Some KBBQ places turn the meat for you, some don't; this place doesn't. But they dumped the entire first order of meat on our grill at once, basically guaranteeing that we weren't going to be able to manage it all in a comprehensible fashion and burn the shit out of some of it.\n\nThe tables were dirty, and they quite unglamorously leave the grills off of them before you sit down, so you just see this greasy drip tray and grill guts to get your appetite going. There were 3-4 young guys running the place, and none of them communicated with each other, so we got asked every question during service by each of them individually and it was really annoying.\n\nThe grill itself is in bad shape and is really inconsistently heated. I did what I could to man the meat, but by the end of our meal, one entire side of the grill was black and charred. No one came by to help us manage the temperature.\n\nReally just kinda felt like you're on your own and they don't really give a shit. Meat is totally bland quality, not flavorful or high-quality (expected at the price point) and the dipping sauces are nasty. One is literally like a Pace Picante salsa basically. Banchan were fresh and tasty, though, so that's one bright point.\n\nDon't waste your time.",

                  "review": "3 photos\nI am having a very hard time writing this review because I am still so full from all the meat I ate last night but also because of how my dining experience ended at this place.\n\nSo let me tell you a story....\n\nMy party of five arrived around 6:30 on a Thursday night, we beat the crowd and there was no wait for a table. The parking lot was a bit crowded but we were still able to find parking easily (make sure you don't park in the Chase Bank parking lot).\n\nThey have a menu for non-AYCE but we decided to do AYCE. It was $17/person and they have a lot of options (pork belly, bulgogi, beef tongue, squid, chicken, brisket....). It is a bit pricey in my opinion but I guess it is for the convenience of being the rare AYCE KBBQ places in West LA/Sawtelle. UCLA Bruins can come here easily without having to make the drive to KTown.\n\nWe ordered 4 types of meat to start off and also asked for the steamed eggs and tofu soup. Since this place is an extension of Tofu-Ya (in Sawtelle), their tofu soup was BOMB.COM!! I think I ate this more than the meat itself.\n\nThe side dishes consist of the cold noodle, salad, kimchi, spicy cucumber, potato, and rice paper). All were decent, nothing bad but also nothing spectacular.\n\nI didn't try the squid but my friends loved it. The bulgogi wasn't spectacular but I did enjoy eating it. Pork belly were already cut up in small pieces and brisket seemed pretty fresh (not super frozen or anything).\n\nIt wasn't that hard to flag down the waiters but we did have to ask them to replace the grill each time, unlike the other places I've been to where the waiters come and replace without you asking. I'm not a princess or anything but it does show that the staff is attentive when they do that or even fill your water when it's running low without you asking.\n\nWe asked for the bill and they were able to split the check in multiple credit cards. We left our tips and went outside to take a group picture.\n\nSo here's where SHIT WENT DOWN. One of the waiter approached us and asked \"Excuse me, were you not happy with our service, did we do something wrong?\" Initially, I just thought they were asking for a survey. Then I saw him holding our check and signed credit card slips. My group replied that we didn't have anything wrong. And he continued to tell us that we didn't leave enough tip, and that usually, people tip more than the amount we left.\n\nMy friends and I were so embarrassed and shocked that we were being asked for more tip so we bitterly added a few more dollars to our total...That has never happened to me before and I am always a good tipper. So I ended up paying $22 for MEDIOCRE KBBQ. Should have just went to Road to Seoul or some other place in KTown.\n\nMy dad would always only put $1-2 when we eat at Vietnamese restaurants and I would always sneak in a few more dollars into the tip after he leaves, and even then, the restaurants never chase after us and ask us to tip more.\n\nSo, in summary, I give one star to Galbi King - for the convenient location and for your tofu soup. I definitely will not be returning.",

Note that if you're at a table where people are doing AYCE then everyone has to do it.\n\nAll in all, a nice local KBBQ place that always satisfies. Not the best KBBQ you'll ever have, but definitely a place I recommend for people on the Westside.",

The banchans are not only good but they were fresh!

AS well as calamari steak and spicy bbq pork (cooked in kitchen, brought out to you).\n\nWe ALWAYS get, in this order:\n- Beef Brisket\n- Beef Tongue\n- 2-4 orders of Short Rib\n\nUnlimited banchan, including rice paper and tortillas if you should so please.

Galbi King was the closest restaurant to my hotel, so I decided to give it a try. $19.95 per person is a great deal (at least for Hawaii standards), but I'm not sure how the price compares to restaurants in LA.\n\nGalbi King is a little hard to find if you are walking to the restaurant. The restaurant itself is a little narrow. They have the regular dining area separate from the yakiniku grills. The menu is only about 16 items long, but they have a number of meat & non-meat options. Also, keep in mind that there must be at least 2 members in your party to be able to enjoy AYCE.\n\nWe kept it simple and only ordered their beef tongue, bulgogi, and beef brisket. The portion sizes were huge! The brisket and beef tongue alone filled a huge party plate. For a party of 2, this was a very generous amount! We really enjoyed the beef tongue and beef brisket. The cuts weren't the best quality, but it was more then we could've gotten at the supermarket for the same price. The only item we didn't care for was the bulgogi since the sauce flavor was a bit too strong.\n\nThe service was also very good. However, like other reviewers mentioned, they are a little forgetful. We ordered rice, but never received it. However, they changed our grill several times without asking and were constantly refilling our water.  \n\nAlso, at the end of our meal, we were also able to receive 5% off the total price as long as we paid cash. Great deal!\n\nMy final opinion on Galbi King? I highly recommend Galbi King if it's within a 10 minute drive/walk for you. Otherwise, there are a lot of other better KBBQ restaurants in LA.",

We came like 20 minutes after it opened and it became filled 30 minutes into eating. For 20 bucks a person this is a steal. My favorite meats are beef tounge and beef belly. This place had it. Other places in Orange County, you would have to pay extra for beef tongue. Service was very fast! The meat would come shortly after you select your meat. They even have tofu soup which wasn't bad according to my girlfriend. I would defintely give this place another try. Keep up the good work guys!",

I drove past this place several times and always wanted to try it since they were the only korean restaurant in the area.  Korea town is 20 minutes away and I didn't feel like diving there and I'm here so why not.  Just like korea town this place has limited parking, even with the private lot in the back it's very scarce.  They do kbbq here but I'm usually alone and opted out for their lunch special of bulgogi box.  For the price you get a lot of food; your entree, side salad, rice, dumplings and miso soup.  Looking at all that food it was pretty overwhelming but taking one bite of that bulgogi and it was ok.  Not as flavorful as I had before and a bit dry.  The dumplings were crispy and delicious while the salad was mostly cabbage.    I didn't try the miso soup since it was pretty hot out and the bowls they came in were pretty big.\n\nOverall Galbi King is decent but Korea Town isn't too far away so might as well make the trip there for some better korean food.\nbulgogi box $10.95",

If Ktown BBQ spots were a bit closer and less busy you know I'd be there in a second but unfortunately that's not the case. Don't get me wrong, the customer service is awesome here and their soups are delicious but I just can't with the AYCE BBQ.\n\nThe brisket has always been too fatty and chewy. I actually had the chicken bulgogi + soon tofu combo $14.95 which was okay but the chicken low key tasted like mostly fat and the soon sofu tasted thick and gritty. I recommend getting the kimchi jjigae (spicy cabbage soup) or mandoo gguk (dumpling soup) - I've never been disappointed with these items.\nChicken Bulgogi + Beef Soon Dooboo / $14.95",

The meat came Grey and VERY fatty.  The meat was also not seasoned, I had to ask for salt and pepper.\n\nThe all you can eat BBQ was $20.00, price was on point but the quality is not there.

This is a Westside AYCE place and if you're looking for some K-BBQ in the area it's a good choice.\n\nThree stars is because there were two of us on this most recent visit and we were looking to try several items. Unfortunately the fatty beef brisket was the first to arrive and they gave us enough for six people. Not exaggerating... it was crazy. And because of this, we were pretty stuffed by the time we were done with it. And because of this, I am only giving three stars. We would have loved to try the squid or some of the other AYCE items.\n\nThe service is nice and it's a chill place to meet up with a small group or friends. But if you're on Sawtelle looking for that K-BBQ cologne, you will be happy you came through.",

We went when the restaurant was basically empty and the service was horrible. We were standing around to be seated when literally every table was open. Then we didn't even have a second to settle in before they pressured us into a meal option.\n\nI received a straw that looked like it was mauled by a dog and water that had some white dust specs in it. I was already wanting to leave but they had already brought us some food. At first they gave us a dribble of sauce and when we asked for more she gave a slightly bigger sauce pan which the waiter said we could share. When we asked for rice a small bowl for us to share. The clearly didn't understand the idea of all you can eat.\n\nWe finished our first plate of meat which was really underwhelming but we wanted to give the other food a shot. Did not get our second order of meet for a whole twenty minutes; again the restaurant was EMPTY and we still couldn't get service.\n\nBAD food, BAD service, BAD utensils. Really struggling to find any positive to this location.\nSee all photos from Josue C. for Galbi King",

You can't make reservations and the parking was a little difficult for our group but we managed and only waited for about 10 minutes before we were seated.\n\nThis is one of the better AYCE places I've been too but not the best. However for $20 it's worth it. Our server was great and checked in on us frequently. There was a lot of variety for us on the menu and the sides were also refilled as soon as we asked. One con is that the fire was way too strong and I could see the flames coming up a lot. The grills had to be changed far more frequently here than any other place I've been too. Overall our group was extremely satisfied with the food and the service here.",

The brisket, galbi, bulgogi and beef belly were ok, but throw some beer on it while its grilling, and make use of the sesame oil! The spicy chicken and squid were rather bland- I would save your stomach space.\n\nThe meat came out fairly quickly, but for other things like water refills or requesting additional bowls/sauces, you will have to try to flag a staff member down multiple times\n\nThe private lot only has a few spots designated for galbi king parking, so arrive a few minutes early to find a parking space!",

Since it was a weekend and the banks were closed, my friend and I decided to risk it and park on the Chase parking. No ticket :)\n\nWe basically tried everything on the AYCE $20 menu. They were all so good! My favorite would have to be the short ribs! I was able to get onions and mushrooms too, can't eat KBBQ without them.\n\nThe only reason why this place isn't a 4-star place is because of the service. There was only one server helping the whole area that night. Poor guy was running around and did the best that he could. He was very nice and when I reminded him of my orders, he kept saying sorry and tried to get them as fast as he could. I understood the situation and I know it wasn't his fault. They were short staffed and I think they needed more than one server.\n\nI would totally go back again!",

Can't decide if you want Soon Dubu, Korean BBQ, or Bibimbap? No problem, you don't have to choose. Get the AYCE KBBQ which includes Soon Dubu and Bibimbap plus some basic Banchan, Steamed Egg Custard, and Sliced Rice Cake Wrappers. The All-You-Can-Eat deal is still $16.99.\n\n2. This isn't the best Korean food in L.A., but at least it is convenient Korean food in West L.A. When you don't want to drive down to Koreatown, then Gabli King at the corner of National & Sawtelle will do. Parking is free and you'll leave full.\n\nAbout the only thing that seems to have changed at Galbi King is the 5% discount for cash is no longer available. So, use a credit card that gives points/rebates.\n\nThe brisket, short rib, and beef tongue for the BBQ is equal to the quality of the Soon Tofu and Bibimbap ... 3 stars. It's no coincidence that Galbi King is the same as Tofuya was ... 3 stars.\nSee all photos from Michael S. for Galbi King",

EXCEPT THE SERVICE!\n\nI saw multiple reviews talking about how terrible the service was and I don't understand how the owner doesn't feel embarrassed or the need to address this to the employees. It's actually hard to even say the service was bad because it's more like the service was non existent. Came here because my friend suggested it. She had already warned me that the service wasn't good, but she said the food and the price would make up for it. She was totally right.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the person at the entrance barely looked at us when we walked in. Didn't say a word. We signed in on the clip board and he still said nothing... he didn't even look up at us from whatever he was doing. How hard is it to at least look at us???? LOL. We stood at the entrance for about five minutes and then my friend asked how long the wait was going to be. The guy said 15-20 minutes and that was it.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes passed, that same guy called our name and started walking us to our table and then he stopped half way and said \"down there on the right\" LOL. There were two tables on the right and they were both dirty in some way. The first one had a bin full of dirty dishes on the ground and the second one had a dirty grill and crap all over the seats. We sat at the one with the dirty grill and just brushed the food off the seat. The good thing is, as soon as we sat down, someone did come and replace the grill. Right after that, the same guy who was working at the front, came to take our order (even though we just sat down). We quickly looked at the menu on the wall and ordered the boneless short ribs, bulgolgi, spicy bulgogi, and brisket. I felt super rushed when we were ordering. The guy taking our order was like really frantic for whatever reason! It seemed like he was annoyed and wanted us to hurry and order, even though we really weren't even taking long at all!\n\nI was irritated, but luckily, the food came out really fast and I was definitely a happy camper! The portions of the meet were SO BIG!! I've never been to a Korean BBQ place with portions that big! We got the brisket first and it was a huge plate, even for four people to split. I was feeling pretty content after we finished the brisket. We cooked the bulgolgi next and oh my goodness, it was delicious!! The flavor was so rich and it was so tasty! The meat was great quality. We only cooked half of the bulgolgi and we started getting full. The spicy bulgolgi came out cooked on a small plate, which I wasn't expecting, but it was also really good. The last thing we cooked was the boneless short ribs and it was good, but I don't particularly care for short ribs so I didn't enjoy it as much as the other meats. The side dishes were all really good and the portions were also very large. The cucumber kimchi was some of the best I've had in a while. I believe the price per person is like $20 and some change. Absolutely worth it... even with the bad service. To me, the food here is even better the Gen's... I would definitely love to come back for the great food... I do hope the service improves!\nSee all photos from Lex S. for Galbi King",

They give you various types of banchan but don't even give you any cabbage kimchi.  Say what?!  Cabbage kimchi is a staple in any Korean bbq joint, but apparently not this one.  At least the kimchi tofu soup was good, but let's face it, I'm not coming here for the soup now am I?  \n\nService was poor.  We asked for more sesame oil that never came.  We had to flag them down for everything.  Water wasn't refilled till our meal was almost over.  \n\nThis place is completely disappointing.  If the price was lower, it might be reasonable, but for what it costs and for what you get, I'd say that you're better off going somewhere else.",

                  "review": "Being in W. LA (west of 405) We're kind of stuck finding any korean bbq close by so Galbi King is pretty much the only one BUT the service is terrible! The food for the price is not bad but the quality of the meats keep changing, so does the seasoning in the meats. I think this location has changed hands at least three times in the last several years.\n\nBut seriously the service is bad and I cant really blame the waiters for the bad service because obviously it's been going on for a while and the owners must be allowing it and they're getting away with it.  It's been going on for some time and if you check the other recent reviews you'll see that I'm not alone. Do they deserve a gratitude tip if they act this way?\n\n**Big Tip: Don't let the waiter put the meat on the grill for you, he'll put the whole massive plate of meat on it and usually before the grill is properly up to temp making the meat soggy in a steamy way rather than properly grilled. They want to flip the tables as quickly as they can, fill you up and on the way you go!\n\n** Second tip: Don't let them bring the cheap, greasy stuff to fill you up on. It's a fixed all you can eat price so they love giving you a massive plate of the cheap pork belly or beef belly which is almost like bacon or tripe without the flavor, it's not very good and they'll bring you a massive plate of it and I mean massive,  the photo's do not do it justice on how big they can be.\n\n***Go for the short rib, the beef bulgogi and the squid. Some may like the beef tongue but only order a 1/2 plate to try out. In fact, if your new to the place, make sure you only order half plates of each order so you don't get stuck having to eat a whole plate your not fond of. A whole dish can feed four people depending on who you are and how hungry you are. Also order the soup and egg dish, they're good and it's included. You're also allowed to order as many sides as you want which are also good.\n\n****Oh yeah, they close really, really early even on Friday & Saturday nights, tonight they were trying to make us pay our bill by 9:30 to close out the register and last call was around 9:20 pm; at 10:00 almost all the grills were off the tables. The waiter wanted us gone and not in a nice way at 10:00 PM. So consider the place closing by 9:30 and you'll start getting the stink eye by 9:31 to pay up and finish which kind of sucks since usually it's 1/2+ hr wait to sit down. Again, do they deserve a gratitude tip if they act this way?\n\nThis place would be so successful if they didn't do as described above, Going to Korean town is a much better experience. This place totally has a captive audience west of the 405 and most of w.la.",

Especially when you have K-Town (heaven) just a few miles eastward.\n\nIn the context of KBBQ in a vacuum, Galbi King is just OK. For what you're paying, it's surely not in the same league as similarly priced KBBQ places elsewhere in LA. However...\n\nIn the context of KBBQ in West LA, Galbi King is pretty damn good. AYCE middle grade meats, generous sides, fast service, and great ventilation makes this place somewhere I would definitely come back to. It has generous parking and the wait isn't horrific either. As a resident of Santa Monica, I'm definitely coming here for my quick fix when K-Town seems too far a drive away.",

                  "review": "2 photos\nGalbi King is, sadly, not the king of galbi.  I've been to this restaurant several times, and I've always found the service lacking.  This might be due to the fact that there are only 2-3 workers on the actual restaurant floor, changing grills, taking orders, and bringing meat.  The restaurant itself is pretty small, so prepare to wait at least 30 minutes or more if you come on a weekend during prime dinner hours.  If you didn't wear your stretchy pants, there are options other than AYCE, so ask for a menu or scope out the pre-selected meat plates.\n\nAs previously mentioned, I didn't think it was possible for a restaurant called Galbi King to serve mediocre galbi, but I found their short ribs disappointing (read: flavorless).  My friends and I agreed that the black pork belly was almost inedible, as it was incredibly tough.  The spicy squid, bulgogi, and brisket were decent, and were the only items we ordered more of.  The banchan are okay, but I would have liked more variety.  Most of the banchan are similar in taste and quality to what's served at Galbi King's sister restaurant, TofuYa on Sawtelle.  (Even the menus and chopsticks say TofuYa.)  The variety of other sides is decent, given the option to order gyeranjjim (steamed egg), soondubu (beef, pork, or mixed seafood tofu soup), and bibimbap.  Noticeably absent is one of my personal favorites, pajeon (fried pancake).  Our server laughed at us when we tried to order the latter, informing us that tortillas weren't pancakes.  Well, duh.\n\nPresumably the prices have increased in the last few weeks, as the posted notices next to each booth (pictured below) state that AYCE now costs $19.95.  I assume that the electronic sign outside of the restaurant is no longer accurate since it still advertises AYCE for $16.95, but given the questionable math on our bill, I wouldn't be surprised if we were simply overcharged.  The servers had calculated our bill by hand, listing the credit card and cash (5% off!) total at the bottom of our tab.  And, their suggested tips, also calculated manually, were higher than what 15% or 20% should have been.  We paid in cash, but I later realized that we only received 4.5% off our total.  And I thought I was bad at math...\n\nTLDR: At Galbi King, you're probably paying more for convenience, as the quality of meat is average and the service iffy.\nPork, brisket, and sides\nUpdated AYCE menu",

The menu selection is a bit small but it has all the basics: brisket, pork belly, galbi, beef tongue, chicken, squid, etc. The quality of the meats were decent.. Some were a hit or miss. Not exceptional KBBQ but if you find yourself in West LA and don't want to hop onto the 10 towards Ktown during traffic hour, this will do.\n\nSomething to note is that their pork belly is cut extremely thin. I heard the table next to us requesting a thicker cut so I guess you can get it sliced normally upon request.",

ESP this location bc it's one of the better ones in West L.A.\nSo def expect a wait or get here very early.\n\nThey give you a side of dduk ssam which is unheard of in the east coast nor have I ever had it in Korea. It's basically dduk but in small thin slices. Most of the side items were delicious. The beef soon doo boo was so tasty! You can def tell that this place has a soon doo boo business. The only side item I wasn't crazy about was the slaw. Instead of salad they give you this slaw which reminded me of cold slaw. Ehh\n\nOk so for the best part of the AYCE part. The Gogi! kalbi was pretty good, the samgyupsal was lacking though. It was cut too thin and didn't have that flavor that made it good. We also got beef brisket which wasn't bad and the fatty brisket. The fatty brisket was pretty solid. We also got spicy pork (just not a big fan in general of this so I wasn't impressed) Overall, if you're craving kalbi and don't feel like hiking it over to ktown, this place isn't bad. I would give this place 3.5 stars.\nDduk ssam",

The brisket on the other hand is not cut thin enough for my taste. The marinated short ribs were awesome though!

My group sat for 10-15 minutes at times with no meat, water, or a dirty grill and no waiter would come by at all. Eventually a table next to us had to get up and go flag one down to take care of the back tables. However the staff was very polite and hardworking; just seems like there aren't enough of them to handle all the demand.\n\nOverall, I would much rather go to ktown for better kbbq but Galbi King isn't a bad alternative closer to home.",

                  "review": "$20 for Korean AYCE BBQ is pretty darn good.  The meat on the other hand is not so good.  But, the extra convenience of not having to drive to Ktown makes this deal totally worth it.  Get the marinated short ribs, the brisket and the steamed egg.  The other stuff is really not that good.  Avoid the pork belly unless you like dry bacon.  Oddly, first time I have seen tortillas and salsa as sides.",

                  "review": "This place SUCKS. Worst service of 2019.\n\nWhile their brisket and tofu soup was quite good-- their service was TERRIBLE. I would not recommend this place with how everyone acted. They basically cheated us.\n\nThe parking was kind of packed and there were a lot of reserved parking spots for the other buildings that made finding a spot a struggle.\n\nWe got there around 8:40 and we put our name right away. We waited for around 50 minutes and patiently and decided to stuck around to eat here. We got seated around 9:30. Which was weird because (what we were not aware about) they were close to closing yet we weren't getting seated despite the possibility that many were leaving. Even as we were making our way to the table, I noticed a few empty tables. The table was also a little greasy when we were seated.\n\nWe decided to get AYCE (All You Can Eat) -- you choose whether you want AYCE or REG  when you sign your name on the list, but nobody warned us beforehand that the kitchen would be closing in 15 minutes -- until they told us our last warning for orders. The waiter even rushly said it was the last order where my whole party didn't catch it. Luckily, I was able to catch the \"final\" word part he said and decided to question them. Only THEN did they mention to us that they're closing.\n\nThe food was okay. The brisket was pretty good, but the pork belly was fatty and rough -- with the bulgogi looking questionable. The tofu soup was pretty good. I did not feel comfortable with the brisket and pork belly mixed in the same plate, however.\n\nShocked and surprused, we explained our situation and asked when we would have to leave and what we could do. They just kept repeating that they close at 10 and finally told us that they'd give us an extra 10 minutes after closing. They even had the audacity to even state, \"We thought you knew.\" Of course nobody decides to eat AYCE in the span of 20 minutes. We decided to order more food and eat quickly to fit the time.\n\nEven in all of this mess, they managed to still give us bad service. They messed up our orders and kept rushing past us when we wanted something and even forgot to give us orders plenty of times -- even as simple as water (which we left before we even got it after we reminded them).\n\nThe only times they really visited us was dealing with our check. All of the servers kept ignoring and rushing past us despite having only around 3 tables -- which I would assume they were at least close to being finished and did not require as much service. We haven't even finished our food, but they already gave our checks. This can be kind of understandable in this situation, however the waiters kept ordering us to give our cards and sign it in a very rude manner -- we just left right after signing our receipts in frustration.\n\nI feel like this situation would have gone better if they were nicer in this misunderstanding. They also didn't have any obvious signs of their hours, so whatever they tried to argue that they thought we knew is nonsense.\n\nLong story short\n\nParking: 2/5\nService: 0/5\nFood: 3/5\n\nSave yourself and go to another Korean BBQ. This place was horrible and I have seen better service in $11 KBBQs.",

It was amazing; those were the glory days.\n\nNowadays, I settle for the dol sot bi bim bap (stone pot bi bim bap) and soondubu (spicy tofu soup) combo! Amazing price and a lot of food! Make sure you let the bi bim bap sit for a little so the rice gets extra crispy and then add your spicies, stir it up and let it sit again to get even moorrrrree crispies!

And this place is pretty good.  Certainly nobody goes hungry.\n\nRecently they bumped the price up from about $17 to $20.  The meat improved at the same time so I guess this is ok.\n\nAlways have a fun time here.\n\nIf you are looking for AYCE KBBQ in Santa Monica/West LA then this is the place to go.\n\nThere is a 5% cash discount.

They have a good selection of meat to choose from and all sorts of other great add ones such as tofu soup, salad and bibimbap that come with the AYCE. The typical sides for korean bbq are all there as well.\n\nThe waiters are completely busy trying to service the crowd. They are understaffed and that is what keeps them from getting a 5th star. Maybe I am being too kind to give 4, but again, with the right expectations, this is a gem. The waiters will get to you, and they won't pressure you to leave so just relax and enjoy cooking and eating.\n\nAlso, get a pitcher of cold beer.

Arrived at about 530pm so early-ish in the evening. There were about 6-8 other tables already there so decently busy. Got sat right away and server quickly greeted us. I must say we were preparing for terrible service based on the previous reviews but it was surprisingly attentive throughout the meal. Multiple servers checked on us and never had to wait long or ask twice for anything. Reorders and grill changes were quick. AYCE menu does not have as many options as some of the ktown favorites but it is workable. Banchan is fine, gf thought the kimchi was a little off. And the price is super reasonable for AYCE.\n\nPerhaps the flurry of bad reviews had us going in with lower than normal expectations but this ended up exceeding. I know everyone says this but for west of the 405 (even if just barely lol) I'm not sure you'll find a better kbbq option!",

Before leaving the laboratory we checked yelp, we live in San Fernando Valley so we're not familiar with the area and this is what it showed us.\nFrom there to this place is about 30 mins drive but we don't mind because we were craving for Korean Bbq.\n\nWe got there around 3:30 pm and they're not busy at all! Maybe 2 or 3 customers only. We sat down and started looking at menu on the wall and it says that \"Maximum 2 hrs\" to dine in. So we ordered then start eating.\nAbout 1 HOUR later this guy came up to our table to gave us our check and said that there is a 15% tip! REALLY?????? WE'RE NOT EVEN DONE EATING YET AND WE FEEL THAT THEY'RE RUSHING US!!!!  \n\nWe've been to a lot of Korean place and this is the only place that really got us upset!!!! I think they're really rude!!!! We won't be coming back here for sure and will tell all our friends not to come here either!",

Normally we're not ones to pay $20 for KBBQ because there are cheaper versions that are just as delicious else where but like I said we were starving.\n\nSo this is the first place I tried Bibimbap and I thought it was quite delicious but of course I got it at the end of the dining experience. This bummed me out because it was hard to get sides refilled because they were attending other customers and it seemed under staffed.\n\nSo we filled up on a lot of meat. But the only meat that got them 4 stars was the boneless short rib. I don't know what it was or what type of sorcery it was or maybe I was just starving but it stood out from all other cuts.\n\nConclusion:\nLet's just say we still talk about how good the meat was that day. We're still in the works of coming back.",

I can get why you'd pick this, or you'd suffer through the journey as a Westsider. Unfortunately you pay the price in experience and quality going here rather than to the source (tm).\n\nWithout the full KBBQ experience it's a much better choice to go to Seoul House of Tofu and order one of their bulgogi or meat dishes than it is to put up with the decidedly inferior meat and flavorings here.\n\nThe line every Sunday night is quite insane. If I drive in, high hopes, I inevitably see the same family of 8 lined up at 7:45 with about 3 other groups and decide to leave.",

Wait staff can be a bit tricky to flag down, but I have yet to encounter a complaint with them.\n\nJust remember that your eyes are only as big as your stomach here, and that you may leave in a food coma.

We had better KBBQ/AYCE restaurants but if you don't feel like driving to Ktown in the horrible traffic, then Galbi  King can be that option.\n\nTheir AYCE KBBQ is $16.95 per person and they provide alot for the price. Standard meat options, steamed egg or soon tofu soup,  and banchan (side dishes). We ordered the soon dooboo (tofu soup), bulgogi meat, kalbi to start off with. The portions were huge! Usually, my husband and I will order at least 4 meats, but the portions at Galbi King was so much that we didn't really achieve the AYCE value. We were done after our first 2 orders of meat. The kimchi they served was really good, tofu soup was very spicy to my liking and had a mixture of seafood and beef strips.\n\nI had no complaints about their customer service although I did feel bad for their busboy/waiter. He was cleaning the tables, setting them, taking down orders, serving food, and cleaning. He always refilled our drinks on a timely manner, and he would check in on us every so often.\n\nI will defintely return to Galbi King again!\nSpicy tofu soup. You can ask for a milder or even no spicy soup. If your ballsy, then you can order extra spicy version.",

Ive looked and looked everywhere but Galbi King is simply the only place. The kimchi is so good and the food is just A1.\n\nHOWEVER the service S U C K S you have no idea. The employees give so much attitude and are really impatient. I don't know why because my friends and i always go back and spend a lot there.\nThis chunkier server gives my friend so much attitude and one time tried charging him and everyone in his party for rice. My friend brought it to his attention, because we've been there a lot and we know that rice is included in the all you can eat deal. The server rolled his eyes and gave my friend & his party SO MUCH attitude. When he went back with me the server was incredibly rude yet again. Not sure what his problem is.\n\nThe owner is a little sassy as well but I feel as though they read some of the reviews because last time they were a little better. Theres a latin looking server who is AWESOME he is so sweet and very attentive. Sometimes my friends and I overwhelm the servers because we know if we don't tell them what we want asap it'll take another 30 minutes to get a server's attention again. But the latin looking waiter always comes around and takes care of us.\n\nIf you have a big party you will most likely have to wait because it gets kind of packed. Even though it says it closes at 9 it really closes by 8:30. I tried going with my boyfriend on his birthday around 8:20 and they rudely told me I could not be seated which was really annoying because their hours say they close at 9.\n\nBut honestly I keep going back for the food. It is always so so good. I'm from Downey area and I can always get that type of KBBQ around our area in cerritos or in Whittier but when I go to school on the west side there is no place that has Galbi's food for that price.\n\nOverall: good food, great price, crappy service, small place.",

They have somewhat a variety of options to choose from. The bulgogi and short ribs are definitely very good. They also give you your normal side dishes along with rice and a salad bowl to share. It's small and sometimes could have a wait time if you arrive in the evening. For about $20 AYCE it's not that bad.\nThese salads are sooo good.\nCooking some good food.",

We came around 8:30 and there were about 5 parties ahead of us on the list. They don't take reservations. I thought it would take really long but we only waited around 25 minutes max.\n\nWe were seated and ordered pretty quickly. The three of us shared the seasoned beef (?) to BBQ on the grill in front of us. My bf and I shared the beef Soondoobu tofu soup and Dolsot Bibimbap(in the stone to cook). That was the best Dolsot Bibimbap I've ever had!! The tofu soup was also incredible, and they give you the egg to crack into the bowl yourself. They let you choose soup spiciness as well. The 2 or 3 was perfect for us.\n\nThey also bring you rice and Banchan ( the free sides that come with the meal like fish cake, some veggies, bean sprouts, a salad, potato salad, and Kim chee of course). I also love those square rice paper noodle sheets that I eat with my meat. Their dipping sauces were also incredible! They had the typical dark brown clear sauce and their second was a sweet spicy sauce that was soooo good. I dipped it in both. Our total came out to about 18 dollars with tip but we had leftovers. Their portions are a great size to even share.\n\nAfter reading others reviews I thought the service would be terrible. I don't think it was bad at all. The workers are just all very busy and hardworking that they don't have time to converse but I find that normal of Korean restaurants. They brought us whatever we needed and changed our stove for us when it became charred.\n\nI will definitely return here maybe to do AYCE next time. It's close to Sawtelle which completely beats driving all the way to Korea Town which has terrible parking and is much further from me. Great place with great food!!",

Given that I live in Gardena and there are plenty of quality Korean BBQ spots, I have an above-average standard for bbq, but I was more disappointed than expected.  First of all, they were understaffed. The two workers and two bussers could not handle the dinner crowd. They were all nice and pleasant enough, but we had to ask for everything, sometimes multiple times and they were very rushed. It took 10 mins to get a menu (doh, then we realized it was on the wall!) and 15 for a bowl of rice and even longer (we asked 3 people) to change our grill. Secondly, the quality of meats was just average.  I didn't dislike any meat such as the beef tongue or bulgogi, but nothing was memorable and therewere no stand-out choice cuts. Strange- they don't give you rice or rice paper unless you ask.  Also, the ventilation was bad - it was extremly smokey in there. My key chain, eye glasses and purse reeked went I went to work the next day.\n\nDrive the extra miles to K-town! Or visit the Southbay cities like Gardena (Moon BBQ, Yellow Cow, Jang Soo) or even Torrance (Guh Mok, even trendy Gen) for better options with better parking.\n\nBTW, I rarely ring those bell things at Korean resturants; I don't need to because the staff can manage their tables, but Galbi King needs to get some! Or hire more people for rush hours.",

We ordered the brisket, spicy chicken and marinated beef. We thought the portions were going to be small so that's why we ordered so much. The portions were HUGE. I don't know if I would recommend the AYCE if it's for two people since they charge if you leave meat. The marinated beef was my favorite of the three. The others were a lil bland. The sauce dish that was served to me had a bug floating in it with its wings still fluttering. The bean sprouts were a bit too brown and limp for my standards. The rice papers had sauces leftover from the people people us. I am surprised we still ate here to be honest.  I would compare this AYCE KBBQ place to a $10 AYCE KBBQ place in Koreatown. The people sitting behind us asked for a menu which we should've done. We could have ordered a la carte and saved $30. It sucks how it has the westside prices of $20. I think if I wanted some marinated Asian meat on the westside, I would go to happy hour at Gyu Kaku. We shall see how my stomach feels in the next few hours :/",

And they have a parking lot, which is obviously rare in LA.  \n\nOnly downside is the don't take reservations and there's often a wait.",

My friend and I were seated in the booth closest to the register, so being constantly ignored was a bit of a shock. Also right across from us was the kitchen area where they dump all the dirty dishes so workers were constantly walking by, which makes it even more amazing that they didn't really pay attention to us. Took forever to flag anyone down for a bit of service.\n\nExtras:\nParking is pretty annoying. For the amount of traffic this place gets there is definitely not enough spots. Thankful the waiting area (outside) is big enough for people to not be on top of each other though.",

Their seating is mostly all booths and the largest group they can sit is about 8 people and you share one grill.  It is AYCE with most of the basics. Pretty much, it is what is expected from a KBBQ place.  Their service is usually pretty good. It can be a little slow sometimes when they are slammed but that's not really that surprising. They do try their best!  \n\nIt's a great option for the Westside without going to Ktown and even better is they have a parking lot that usually has open spaces. I've never had trouble parking when I come which is incredible for the Westside.  Just keep in mind each table is one grill so when you have the bigger group, it's a little slower since one grill and 7 or 8 people means less food per turn.\n\nThey also have other options other than grilling. I brought my parents once and they don't really like to grill so they got bibimbap and other items. Everything was pretty good. My parents were very satisfied.",

I thought this place was okay when it was Tofu-Ya and they are the only game in town on the westside. Exhausted from driving from SD and unwilling to go to K-Town, I just decided to wait 40 mins with my boyfriend to get some kbbq close to my apartment. Nothing was good. The tongue was rubbery and inedible. Bulgogi was okay. The chicken and short ribs tasted like they hadn't been marinated enough, and the banchan was similarly blah.\n\nNext time, I'll just suck it up and drive 20 mins on the 10 for K-bbq that doesn't make me mad.\n\n*This review is just for the all you can eat K-bbq option.",

It's thick.\n- Have to ask for bean paste and vinegar sauce or they won't bring it out.\n- 15 minute wait on a Friday night\n- Clean booths.  Server gave us a clean grill halfway through our meal.\n- Slow service (had to ask for more rice paper 3 times and water refills).\n\nGalbi King is one of the few options for AYCE kbbq on the Westside, so we'll take what we can get.

Favorites: Beef Brisket and Pork Belly.  Order smaller portions if you want to try a variety of meats.  The actual meat quality is not as great as other KBBQ joints, but can't complain.\n\nFrom the past few occasions that I have been here, their service has been disappointing.  We had to consistently flag the servers to get some cups of water, and even the side dishes that are supposed to come with the KBBQ.  Even though it can get super busy, would be nice if the servers checked in at least once during our dining.  \n\nOverall, if you're craving some KBBQ and don't want to make the drive to KTown, this is the spot!  Despite the service and crowd, I'm happy the Westside finally has a quality all you can eat KBBQ.  Annnnnd, they serve sundubu.  Come here hungry.",

Would much rather go to Genwa or road to Seoul or any of the more authentic places in Korea town. 20 dollars is not cheap.... but I felt the meats were poor quality. Brisket was good. Short ribs were just SO fatty and lots of pieces of crunchy weird tendon in the meat. Also, bulgogi was very fatty and just looked like intestine. I am not 100% sure their \"meats\" are actually beef. I felt like I was eating weird organs or non-beef meat. Maybe dog or cat? Wouldn't be excited to go back. The salad was awesome!

Meat selection is limited and price is the same as other places (19.99). I recommend getting the marinated short rib, brisket and bulgogi.\n\nFree parking in the back. The sides are average. Salad looks like chopped cabbage with no flavoring. Seats are way too far from the table which makes it an uncomfortable eating experience. Service was mediocre. You have to flag down the staff to get something. Everyone seems to be in a rush and always forgetting one table to tend to the next, like a big circle so everyone feels the same way.\n\nI like this place because it's close, free parking and short rib is good.\n\nKnocked off a star for service.

I think it's so great to have a Korean BBQ place outside of K-town that we can eat at.\n\nI'm giving this place four stars because the food is great, and the waiters are nice. They're always SUPER busy, so I don't usually expect too much by way of coddling. But, over time, I've gotten to know the level of service to expect.\n\nThe one suggestion that I would have is that the waiters check in with the tables more often. Sometimes, they get so busy that you're left waiting for somebody to come and check in with you. Though, I personally wouldn't let that stop me from eating at this place - it's great!

Im sorry to the family eating their food, that i didn't warn you about what you were about to eat. So mid way of our meal our waiter? the busser? Came to give us a water refill and we noticed he was sweating bullets. Whatever poor guy, its abuse having him work with no air. Then he turns to the table next to us and gives people refills and we see slow motion 3 drops of sweat fall onto the peoples meat on the grill.

The cheap stuff at the big kbbq places. So what's wrong with this place? The staff. No other way to put it other than they are very unapproachable and short. You can tell when you ask for any little thing they are annoyed. Extra sides, no eye contact. Can I have a coke, walks away without saying anything. Can we get rice paper and salad, rice paper forgot salad. Very easy fix, smile and appreciate your customers. The better the service the better the tip! They walk by so fast knowing you need things but do their best to avoid you. It's not like this is the first time I've been here, 3rd now. It's almost a running joke with the people I go with.

The food has always been good but we have found it has improved since our initial ventures here.  The banchan or side dishes are delicious and plentiful.  Imagine if your standard foodie place brought tasty small sides to your table and replenished them with abandon.   For the mains I love the spicy tofu clam soup.  My husband loves the all you can eat BBQ, seafood pancake and steamed egg.  You can grill your food at your table or they will cook it for you.  Harry the head waiter is a character and we adore him.  He does an excellent job keeping the flow of the restaurant moving.  It can be difficult due to the popularity of this place.  Most of the best Korean food is downtown in LA.  Galbi King holds its own and makes sure we can all get our gochujang fix.",

Located in a strip mall, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but as soon as you walk in, the smell of the grilled meats will make your mouth water.\n\nThe All-You-Can-Eat deal (for $19.95) includes a wide selection of meats--from Bulgogi (marinated beef with onions) to Brisket to Spicy Chicken Breast to Black Pork Belly--that are all tasty with their three dipping sauces. You will be amazed (and slightly disgusted) by the sheer amount of food you can consume in one sitting! And of course, every portion they bring out to the table is MASSIVE so you'll have plenty to cook at your table. They also have a lot of unlimited sides they'll bring at the start of your meal as well, like rice paper wrappers, steamed egg, tofu soup, kimchi, potato salad, rice, bean sprouts, noodles...the list goes on! I didn't even know what half of it was to be honest but I can respect the variety.\n\nThe service isn't the best here but they get it done eventually and they'll switch out your grill every once in a while when it starts to get gross. I've seen a lot of other reviews complaining about the \"quality of meat\" or whatever, but honestly, you're paying $20 for literally all the food you can eat so deal with it. And it's not bad meat either! Everything I've had here has been delicious. The wait is usually reasonable too, especially since most of their tables can accommodate larger parties. One last thing to note, you WILL smell like Korean BBQ for a couple of days after eating here. But it's totally worth it, right?",

The servers act quickly but to the point where I feel rushed and uncomfortable. When they're not acting quick they probably don't notice you at all. Also-- I didn't appreciate how one of the servers asked us a question, and WALKED AWAY literally 2 seconds after.... we couldn't even answer. As for the food, the quality is definitely NOT worth $20. We ordered the brisket and beef belly which came in a fairly hearty portion. We then ordered the short rib and bulgogi. We wanted to ask for a grill change but they IMMEDIATELY threw the short rib and bulgogi on the grill-- WHICH SERVED WERE ON THE SAME PLATE. The raw short rib was UNDERNEATH the raw bulgogi which caused an immediate loss of appetite. I wish they would've just placed the meats down for us so we could eat them at our own pace. I would not reccommend coming here.",

The restaurant itself has tables pretty close together so it can get claustrophobic at times, but it is an older building so I expected that.\n\nService:\nWhen going to a Korean restaurant, service is always on demand via an electronic button or by calling them with a raised hand. They were pretty attentive and nice, which can't be said about all Korean BBQ places. Having said that, they are above average for service.\n\nFood:\nStandard sets available for AYCE Korean BBQ. My favorites are always brisket and beef tongue, but some of the marinated pork here is good, too. I like the cuts from the beef tongue being a little thicker than normal, because that gives it more flavor and texture upon cooking. Brisket is standard and they also include the awesome sesame oil with salt for dipping. Other appetizer dishes are okay; I especially liked the mashed potatoes and their soft rice paper.\n\nOverall: 3/5\nThis ain't the best Korean BBQ place, but it is still a good stop if you need to satiate that craving. I would come here again if I was in the area and wanting a Korean BBQ fix. The food is pretty standard with Korean BBQ, and the parking is tough, but otherwise it's a good place to go.",

The waiter rudely said \"yes. We close at 10\". We said, \"yes, but it's 9:30\" and we had to wait for a table. You just seated us and you are telling us it is last call?\n\nWaiter says \"it's not our fault you came late\" lol, Incredible. We came at 9, waited for a table, and had just started cooking our first round.\n\nOk. Can we order some more food then? Nope. Not until you finish your current plates, which we JUST received. And there is a 3 plate cap per order. So basically, we were capped and couldn't order any more food.\n\nAfter some complaints, they finally let us order more. But of course every plate came with a warning to finish everything or they would charge us. Wtf is wrong with these people. Oh but of course they had no problem brining out the overpriced drinks, late!\n\nBelieve all the negative reviews for this place. It's a joke.\n\nI read exactly the same thing before coming. They really are like this.\n\nFood is mediocre. Service is terrible. (The Latino guys were cool.) The Korean guys were rude.\n\nDONT COME HERE",

I read the reviews beforehand and a lot of people mentioned about how rude the staff were or how often they forgot to bring what was asked. I decided to see myself if this was true and YES. The service is terrible because 99% of their staff seem very forgetful. No one ever came to refill our drinks, sides, or asked if there was anything additional we need. When we did ask for refills of our sides, drinks, and ordered another round of meat, it was never brought to our table. Only 1 out of the 3 meats we requested for, was brought. I don't know what happened to the other 2 meat or sides we requested for. It got to the point where it was annoying to have to keep asking them to bring our sides, meats, etc. Their staff are not on the same page and need better training because they're very forgetful. You'll sit there waiting for your side and drink refills, and to order another round of meat. The reason for 3 stars is because of the service. You shouldn't have to wait 25+ minutes for side and water refills.",

Decided to give Galbi King a try.\n\nWe waited for about 30 minutes to be seated at around 7 PM . Is it me or everywhere in LA area has a wait time for dinner ? It also didn't help that they don't take reservation.  The menu has a wide variety of meat for $21 dollars. The waiter was prompt and came back to check often in the beginning , towards the end it was a little harder to get a hold of him. We weren't too concern since we were in a mild food coma.\n\nMust try are the beef tongue. It's cut a little thicker than usual but I really enjoyed it when I was there.  They start of with a huge portion of food so if you want to try everything you will need to let them know from the get go that you want a small portion.  I also liked how the side dishes were not only one refill ( most of the places in the DC area only allows you to refill it once ) that's always a plus. I don't know why but I'm always addicted to the steam egg that they serve in most Korean restaurants.\n\nThe selection of condiment is very interesting , I'm typically use to the bean paste or the sesame seed oil with pepper and salt. They did have the sesame seed oil , I just had to ask for it. I also like that they have a decent size grill with enough heat to cook your food regardless of where you place them. Some places that I've been to always give you this tiny little grill that you spend more time waiting for you food to cook than to eat it.\n\nThere's free parking at the back of the restaurant but it was really packed on a Thursday night at 7pm so we ended up parking a little further up the street ( probably a good thing since I had to walk off some of the beef brisket that I've consumed) . A quick tip , stop and put your name on the wait list first before going to hunt for parking.\n\nOverall decent place to eat at , I will most probably come back the next time I'm in town.",

I thought the short rib was really soft and tasty, the salad and sides were plentiful, and the staff was really good at offering more food (in my opinion too much food!). Maybe the staff isn't as customer friendly because there's a lot of people to serve in the place, a lot of manual work (ie the frequent changing and replacing grills and bringing plates and plates of meat), and the plain fact that English clearly wasn't a first language for any of the waitstaff. For $20 per person, you gotta give this place a break and try it with some latitude knowing your getting a good deal with a lot of convenience (since you don't have to drive all the way to K-town to satisfy that bulgogi craving).

If you are not Korean or Asian, I would stay clear of this place.\n\nI was seated at this establishment and waited about 20 minutes to be waited on. Then, it took an additional 40 minutes to get my food, and then my server disappeared and I literally could not pay my bill. Then, an Asian gentleman sat down and was waited on IMMEDIATELY by another waiter. He was served his food within 10 minutes. So I was sitting there waiting for my waiter to pick up my check while the guy next to me, finished, paid his bill, and left. His entire visit was 25 minutes and i had been there for 1.5 hours. I finally had enough so I threw my money on the table and left.\n\nA few weeks earlier, I went into this hall of racism, and I was told that they could not seat single people at the BBQ seats. The restaurant was EMPTY. Not to mention, I had been here several times before and sat alone at the bbq table with no issues.\n\nThe owner of Galbi King had better get this place in order, or it will be going out of business within a few years.

I came at 8:30pm and was told 20 minutes, but I was not seated until 9:20pm. Then, as soon as I put my first plate of meat on the grill, I was already given my bill to pay. The entire time they tried to rush us, and made us a last meat call at 9:45pm. Had I known it was a strict laat call I wouldn't have came here at all. Plus most of the booths that you sit at are highly damaged. The meat was pretty awful, and all of the side dishes other than the kimchi were below average. If you want real Korean BBQ, head to ktown.",

Be ready to wait in line if you come around dinner time, especially during winter. Parking is easy and they accept credit card (for cash payment, you get discount). Our dine-in order always on the brisket, beef tongue and kalbi. Love the salad that comes with the order and all the side dishes.

When we walked into the creepy front/back entrance my friends and I stood awkwardly by the door for a while before someone seated us. We were then escorted by an indifferent asshole who sighed with inpatients when we asked for menus. He assumed we would be getting the all-you-can eat special and was genuinely shocked that we, customers, wanted to look at menus. He brought us 2... There were 3 of us.\n\nWe ordered out meat stuffs, and we're giving glasses of water. I should specify that straws were not provided and the levels of liquid continued to diminish and were NEVER replenished. Later we realized that our server never offered us anything other than water.... This seemed strange. Wouldn't an eatery want customers to PAY for a beverage??? No, our server never even asked us what we wanted to drink.\n\nThe food was eatable. Although we were given several random bowls of mysterious Korean foods that were given any names or explanation. We kept thinking that one of us could be allergic to something but we wouldn't know because we didn't know what anything was.\n\nWe paid for our food and as we were walking to the car, outside, our server ran up to us and claimed he couldn't read the bill. Our friend had paid the bill and only tipped $5.00 because the service was horrible. The server exclaimed, \"you're only tipping $5.00??\" At the top of his lungs in the parking lot. Even if we wanted to tip more how would screaming at us make our opinions of you and your restaurant increase?\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this place is that we didn't get food poisoning, but I did lose an hour of my life that I will NEVER GET BACK!!\n\nThat is all.",

After being turned off by by its toughness one time at Gyu-Kaku, I had stayed away from it. I didn't realize it could be this tender! My friend asked for some fresh lemon to squeeze on top and it was perfect with that and then dipped in the sesame, salt, pepper combo sauce. Yummy.\n\nThe other highlight for me was the squid! I ate 3 orders of that by myself. Definitely worth it and is an item that not many AYCEs include, so take advantage of it!\n\nThe premium short rib was good and super filling. Next time, I wouldn't order the brisket though since there was so much fat, and I was lazy to clip those parts off.\n\nNot impressed by the banchan at all. For the price, I expected them to be a LOT better. The cucumber tasted weird, the salad (which I usually eat a lot of to balance out all that meat) was gross, the bean sprouts weren't crisp. Potato salad was ok. There werent that many different types too. The only banchan I really liked was the kimchi.\n\nService is the usual can't-find-them-when-you-need-them, which I am more tolerant of (and expect) in K-town. When in W LA and paying these prices, I just expect them to be around more when you want to order your next plate and when you want the grill changed.",

At first I thought it was a decent alternative to driving all the way to K-Town during rush hour traffic, however after my last visit I will NEVER eat here again.\n\nMy husband, sister-in-law and I ate here about 3 weeks ago and we had almost no service at all. We kept having to order everything from the busser, who is the only one really attending the tables. We saw our waiter maybe twice during our meal.\n\nWe spend about $90 on food and drinks and after we are done eating we sat and talked for (maybe) 10 minutes while we paid the bill (not just chit-chatting, we were talking about some deep, heavy stuff). After we signed the check we talked for about 4 more minutes (and we were already getting ready to leave) when the busser storms up to us and says, \"You guys need to leave, we have other people waiting for tables!\" WTF? I just spent almost $100 on dinner here and you're telling me to leave? Not cool. Also, on the way out we saw 2 other EMPTY tables.\n\nI'm over this place. I'd rather sit in traffic and eat at GOOD Korean BBQ in K-Town.",

My only complaint is that they sometimes bring you too much meat on your first order (I'm talking a ridiculous amount of meat disproportionate to the number of people in your party) which ends up limiting your ability to order more later. Otherwise, I like this place and I'll continue visiting it for sure!",

The service was terrible!  I waited an hour and half for my food when the rest of my party was already served.  We reminded them multiple times to bring it out... When they finally did, the order was wrong.  At that point, I just ate rice... Then on the check they over charged us and did not itemize the check. When I asked for them to explain it to me, they said they forgot to add something and they added $20 more to our bill!  When I pointed out that they had over charged us in the first place, they just walked away.  I had to follow them to the register to get it fixed.  Never returning!!!!",

It's $20 per person for AYCE kbbq which is pretty good, but the real value comes from not having to drive all the way to ktown and wait in line for hours. We came here on a Friday night and waited about 30 min for 2 people. I really liked the brisket (#1 on the menu) and I usually really like beef tongue but it's not as good here. Restaurant is not too smokey unlike some other kbbq places, on the day we went at least. Service is good - the waiters were always really quick to bring out the food we ordered, refill the side dishes, and change the grill for us.",

                  "review": "I was craving korean bbq but didn't feel like making the drive out to ktown and found this place on yelp so I decided to give it a try. While some reviews on here complain about service, I personally thought the service was fine and have no complaints there. Honestly, if you're not going to tip decently, then you shouldn't even be eating at restaurants let alone writing reviews on yelp. Part of being a good customer is to be generous which many establishments are to you. Shame on anyone who tips poorly and then complains about their meal. Grow up and learn to tip appropriately.\n\nI came in with my boyfriend around 7pm on a weeknight and there were about 2 tables open but halfway through my meal, everything was full. They asked us if we were doing AYCE and proceeded to set up our table. I'll admit that the restaurant isn't the nicest of places, and they definitely need to do some remodeling if they want to stay competitive. Their prices will run you about the same as a good quality AYCE in ktown. I believe I paid about $25 including tax and tip.\n\nAnyway, on to the food. They had a pretty decent selection of meat and I ordered the beef tongue, brisket, and pork belly. The beef tongue and brisket were a little tough for my liking but the pork belly was pretty good. I stuck to ordering that through most of my meal. I've definitely had better meat at other places but this place wasn't the worst. I'll probably only come back if I really really want korean bbq and can't make it to ktown, but for the most part I'll probably make the drive out. This is a great option for those on the westside though!",

                  "review": "First to Review\nI was craving some KBBQ was hoping to not have to travel all the way to K-Town (since I work in Santa Monica).  A friend of mine told me to meet her at Tofu Ya on National, only to find that the name is now called Galbi King.\n\nThis was my first time at this restaurant, so I can't say how similar it is to Tofu Ya.  But, you enter the parking lot off of Sawtelle Blvd.  Please make note of the signs that specify certain spaces for specific shops.  We walked into the restaurant and immediately was hit in the face by the delicious smell of KBBQ.  I instantly felt the emptiness in the pit of my stomach, I was officially hungry.\n\nWe were walked through the restaurant, passed all the sizzling grills to the front of the restaurant by a window that faced National Blvd.   You can purchase certain meats a la carte, but the best thing to do is get the All You Can Eat deal for $16.99.  We chose to start off with the beef brisket, beef short rib (galbi), and bulgogi.  Soon after, we were given tons and tons of banchan and salad.  They put the first set of meats on the grill, and then slowly bring out the tofu soup and steamed egg in those fun little black pots.  There are also the rice papers and different dipping sauces should you want to use them to compliment the meats.\n\nThe brisket didn't have a lot of flavor, so I dipped it in the spicy sauce and soy (looking) sauce, and then wrapped it in the rice paper.  The combination of all that together, made it super tasty.  The bulgogi was good, but I don't know if it was marinaded long enough for the flavor to completely soak in.  The galbi, on the other hand, was full of the signature KBBQ marinade and made me very happy.  I ate a ton of the galbi, and was happy that they removed the bones for us.    This was definitely my favorite.\n\nTheir tofu soup was spicy, but so delicious.  It had a ton of spices and flavor in it.  My friend and I couldn't stop drinking this.  Usually, the steamed egg is the one dish that I look forward to when I go to eat KBBQ, but this one wasn't the best.  I think it may have been because there were so many green onions in the egg.  I am very simple when it comes to the steamed egg, add a little salt or broth, and I am happy camper.\n\nService was good, although we asked for additional banchan.  The server took the little banchan dishes and never returned lol.  By the time we realized that, we were pretty much done with our meal so we decided not to ask them for it.  For two people, we ordered three different types of meat and we had quite a bit left over.  The portions are much larger than you think they might be.\n\nI will definitely come here again, since it's really close to my work and apartment.  At the end of a work day, I don't want to sit in intense traffic to get to K-town and have BBQ.  So, it's helpful to have Galbi King over on the West side for all us road-ragers.",

                  "review": "Maybe I'm spoiled with good KBBQ because I live in Koreatown, but this place was the most disappointing KBBQ experience ever.\n\n1) Service is obnoxiously slow. I counted ONE waiter on a busy Sunday afternoon. ONE. And ONE busboy. We waited about 20 minutes to get seated and then another 20 minutes just to order our food. This place would be so much more popular if they invested in another waiter and busboy. Seriously.\n\n2) Because of the lack of service, the grill was left on for way too long (even on the lowest heat), making it way too hot. It ruined the way meat is supposed to be cooked. We couldn't even tell if the quality of meat was decent or not because that hot grill made everything burn to a crisp.\n\n3) Ventilation is horrible in there, especially in the back area. I can't say for the front of the restaurant since there's an open door... but the back was a smoky mess. ALSO, my boyfriend had to kill a spider that was hanging down from the ceiling... It almost got in my hair.\n\nI'm for sure never returning... I'd rather pay more and get decent KBBQ with faster service. However, shout out to the one waiter there. We knew he was crazy busy and we tried to leave him alone for the most part, but he had an awesome attitude and was super courteous. He deserves a raise.",

The managers never smile and look like we owe them. Last night we waited for nearly an hour before we finally got seated. And we just had one round (one soup, beef belly, ribs and beef tongue), when we used our phones and rested for a little bit , the manager rushed us to eat!! No one uses their cellphones during meals??? And we didn't have the mood and appetite to eat anymore. After we got home,my husband began to have a running stomach. So we will never ever going there again!",

The entrance to the parking is off of Sawtelle.\n\nThe food is pricier than where all of the Ktown BBQ's are competing but it is still less than $20.

There's usually a long wait, especially if you come Thurs-Sat. It's all you can eat and people eat a lot here. I know I do!\n\nThe meat is yummy! I personally loooove the Bulgogi. It's marinated and so yummy. They come around regularly to make sure you have drinks and everything you need and they change the grill often enough. My friend orders some side yellow garlic oil thing to dip his meat in. It was pretty tasty. Soda comes in cans so that can rack up.

                  "review": "Galbi King is my favourite Korean restaurant on the West Side.  The food is good, the service is decent, the prices are fair, and unusually for a Korean restaurant the menu is very diverse.  \n\nMost Korean restaurants only serve 1-2 specific types of food, e.g. soon tofu, BBQ, sul lung tang, kimbab, but Galbi King has a very extensive menu.  I come here every now and then because my office is nearby, and it makes a great lunch spot.  Most Korean food is spicy at its default setting, and now that being pregnant limits my tolerance for spicy food the kitchen is very good at toning the heat down.  Last time I stopped in I ordered the bulgogi and naengmyeon (cold beef noodle soup) combo.  The bulgogi is flavorful (although a bit sweeter than I like it) and the naengmyeon is deliciously refreshing.  I've also had their soon tofu, their kimchi casserole and their pa-jun (kimchi pancake) and they were delicious.  They're also very generous with their banchan (complimentary side dishes).  The service is good but it does deteriorate if the restaurant gets too crowded.  The prices are very fair.\n\nParking can be a bit of a problem.  The restaurant is in a strip mall with an adjacent lot, but most of the spaces in the lot are reserved for other businesses and there are only a few non-reserved spaces.  You might have to end up parking at the Rite Aid across the street and crossing a busy intersection.\n\nGalbi King will continue to be my go-to Korean restaurant for as long as they continue to offer good food and good value.",

But I give the 'virgin boy on prom night' version aka 'making it quick'.\n\nWhen we first got there it wasn't close to being busy. A few tables on my viewing left side and a few behind me. The employees gave nice attention to the other tables but wifey and I had to put a on a show to get some of that attention. Guess what finally got to me is when I had to ask a Bus Boy if we can have some napkins.\n\nAnyways, I'm a big tipper and proud to give what is deserve for a lovely time out enjoying some good food...oh, I had better AYCE spots out in Gardena and for the price we paid, WWWAAAYYY better spots in Korea Town where the food & experience makes it a night a 'virgin on prom night' can brag about.\n\nNot saying what RACE card was pulled...maybe cause of my skin color or maybe it was we're not your average FANCY dressing like folks out there.\n\nWill we go back = F*#K NO!!",

I knew that based on the fact that this location was on the West side, instead of Koreantown, meant it would probably be inferior and more expensive than similar restaurants in Ktown, but I wasn't ready for this. From the beginning the man who put us on the list was rude, and ignored us in favor of helping an old woman who cut us in line. He also refused to give me or my friend an estimate on how long the wait would be, saying he didn't know and then leaving when we asked for a broad estime. When we were finally sat (a party who arrived after us was seated first) the sides were shitty and limpy. The meat was average, on par with Castle bbq ($12 ayce, and VERY friendly severs who taught us some korean), instead of the $20 they charged us. finally the bill came, and was about $5 more than it should have been. But since it was handwritten and didn't have a breakdown, I bergrudingly paid. Never coming back. Go to Korean town, specifically bulgogi hut or road to seuol, they offer better meat and nicer servers for $20 a head. Beer is cheaper there too!",

You want some Korean BBQ on the Westside then you wait patiently like the 40 other people in line. Went here for the first time tonight. Never, ever noticed it before and I went to Webster for middle school and now live in the neighborhood. It's tucked away in an enclosed strip mall but since there Is no street parking you have to park around the back. Make sure once you get there you sign in right away and make sure if you want to cook at your table you put BBQ next to your name on the sign in. The best deal is the All You Can Eat for $19.99. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was great and it's fun t I cook at your table. The only issue I saw had nothing to do with the food. I think this place needs a woman's touch. We stood near the sign in area and everything over there had a thin or thick layer of dust cover it. The faux flawed, beer boxes and a bag of papers were all dust laden.  There were cobwebs in the corners and it just seemed like the area needed a good wipe down. Other than that, our table was clean and the waiter was attentive.",

They're not as attentive as some of the good ones in Ktown but they won't completely ignore you here. I was pretty disappointed with the following, however:\n\n1. Meat quality is pretty disappointing. The only decent cut are the short ribs and maybe the pork belly. Brisket was bland as hell and we didn't even bother with the rest.\n\n2. The other food, like the bean paste soup and banchan were either stale, dry, watered-down, or old.\n\n3. The grill at the table we sat sucked so badly. It kept burning the meat placed on one corner of it and the other side of the grill took forever to cook.\n\n4. The place is hot as hell and there is virtually no ventilation. They have to keep the doors open to let the smell and smoke out.\n\nThat's about it. Price is fair normally for an AYCE kbbq joint and I did go in with lower expectations for a west LA location that has zero competition around, but despite that I was somehow more disappointed than I thought I would be and probably wouldn't return.",

You can see in multiple reviews that the service isn't that great but you overlook that for the great deal you're getting.\n\nHowever, I went there a couple of weeks ago and our grill in booth #10 was just not heating up enough. We complained multiple times and one of the servers just listened to what we had to say and then walked away without acknowledging what we said or offering to do anything about it. We finally flagged someone else down and asked that our meat be cooked in the kitchen because we couldn't do it ourselves. We couldn't ask to be moved to another booth as it was Friday night and there was already a huge wait. We weren't able to take advantage of the AYCE since it took so long for us to cook just two plates!!!\n\nBut, even though it was a very disappointing evening, I'm sure we'll be back eventually as it's the best AYCE deal on the Westside. Darn the convenient location & awesome price!!!",

Everything was excellent, fresh and plentiful.\n\nThe eel bowl was delicious and the soon tofu with bulgogi beef on the side was really good (the beef was delicious while the tofu stew was ok). The angus raw beef plate was huge and my eyes morphed into two saucers when I saw how much high quality beef you get for your money. We cooked it up while chit-chatting and had a blast!\n\nThe service was erratic but hey we were so busy eating, cooking and downing our beer pitcher that we really didn't notice until the end when we waited (...and waited) to get the check.\n\nIn the end, our bill was 60 bucks without tip and that's for several food items, a pitcher of beer and an agreement to veg out on the couch the rest of the night with a Redbox since you won't be physically capable of motion.\n\nWe will definitely be back!\n\n(...and as a sidebar, people who complained that the servers went after them for leaving ludicrously small tips: get a life and learn to tip. More power to the servers for calling you out!)",

                  "review": "Like many have said before, this is probably the only legit place on the Westside to get AYCE Korean BBQ.  That being the case, I frequent this place more than most others and I can say that while the service is not always consistently excellent, I still find this to be my favorite Korean BBQ place in town.  \n\n3 Huge Factors in my opinion are the spicy korean miso soup, relatively lean cuts of meat compared to other Korean BBQ places, and the fact that they are the ONLY place I've been to in ALL of LA that serves WHITE meat chicken.  I realize that asian restaurants usually use dark meat and so I guess white is less authentic, but I don't care, it makes a world of difference to me.\n\nTo give you some idea of how this place stands up to other Korean BBq places, I'll compare and contrast this place to Hae Jang Chon, which people seem to generally like on Yelp.\n\nPrice: I give it to Galbi King, they have a similar selection of meats but Galbi King is 16.95 compared to Hae Jang Chon which 18.95.\n\nGrill: I give it to Hae Jang Chon, they have stone cylindrical grill which is much less likely to burn the meat than Galbi's rectangular steel grills.\n\nBrisket: I am biased in that I prefer lean cuts of meat so I give it to Galbi.  When my gf and I order brisket, at least half of each cut at Hae's is just fat, while I would say that Galbi's are closer to 80% or more meat.  \n\nBulgolgi: Hae's has the best, most tender Bulgogi I have ever had. Galbi's seems to be a hit or a miss so I tend to shy away from it.  Galbi's comes with a ton of sauce and onions which I really like, but sometimes the meat is a bit stringy but not every time.\n\nChicken: As I have said before, I am biased an prefer white meat to dark.  They both serve BBQ dark meat chicken BTW, but Galbi takes in because it stands alone in the very small world of white meat chicken Korean BBQ.\n\nSides: Most of the sides are about equal in my opinion expect for the salad and the soup.  Hae's has better salad, hands down.  They use softer full leaves of lettuce with a more tangy tasty dressing while Galbi uses harder lettuce shreds and more watery bland dressing.  On the other hand, I absolutely love the spicy korean miso and tofu soup at Galbi and have not tasted better anywhere else. Hae's has more dipping sauces but they tend toward sour while Galbi's tends toward sweetness.  Its really apple and oranges, they are both good in their own way.\n\nService: The waiters at Hae's will actually come and help cook your food for you, which is great except they don't ask you if thats what you wanted them to do.  One of the reasons I come to \"do it yourself BBQ\" places is so I can cook my meat exactly the way I like it, so I prefer Galbi's more hands off approach.  That being said, I'm sure someone else might prefer the extra attention. At Galbi, I find myself perpetually asking for water and getting it about half the time. Hae's alleviates this issue by giving you a large water bottle.\n\nI haven't tried all the meats so I can't really say one is better than the other, but because of the location, white meat chicken, and leaner meat cuts I prefer Galbi King.",

                  "review": "There's nothing worse than unauthentic Korean food. The entire restaurant is filled with smoke because none of the grills have fans that suck up the smoke from the grill. We first ordered the brisket. Some unknown worker came out from the back with this MASSIVE plate of meat, and dumped the entire 1-2 pounds of brisket onto our grill. Um, did I ask for you to do that? No. Usually, at authentic Korean BBQ, the servers will nicely put the plate of meat on your table. After the guy poured the meat on the grill, I asked for an extra plate so I could take some of the meat off. He looked at me, laughed, and said that brisket cooks fast, as if I am some idiot that doesn't know how to cook meat. I asked for a plate, not for the worker to laugh at me and argue against me. Definitely not worth it to go here. The meats taste like they have been in the freezer for months. Save your money and go to an actual Korean BBQ place, instead of Galbi King, a fake excuse of a restaurant operated by money-hungry crooks.",

(The Seoul House of Tofu's is not spicy at all over at Olympic and Sawtelle.)  They will also bring you more helpings of the free appetizers which is nice.  It can be crowded but not packed except the one time I went.  I like the bean sprouts free app best.  The noodles and potato salad free apps are good too, but I'm doing a no carb thing right now.  The spicy chicken and soon tofu combo is a lot of food and wasn't a big fan of the spicy chicken flavoring, but I did take it to go and finish it later.  Never tried the bbq grill part, but it's nice that's it's an option.  They also have an all you can eat for $17 tho not sure what the terms are.",

I have been here a few times and never had this level of treatment.\nFrom the second we showed up the host had a terrible attitude talking trash to us.  We had to ask five to six times to get a glass of water and anything else.  The plates were broken or filthy.  About 30 minutes into the meal my wife and I had hot oil splashing on our legs.  They dumped water under the grill which shot flames up in the air while we sat praying it wouldn't burn us.  The guy at the table next to us was burned with hot grease from the buser changing a grill.  There was a fire from what smelled like burnt plastic which filled the room and smelled disgusting.  The meat is most definitely not high quality.  After all this when we voiced concern about everything they treated us worse and rolled their eyes.  \nThere is a jack and the box across the street where you will find better service, atmosphere and food.  This is not worth it! Avoid this place like the plague!",

Plus side - they have extra large booths for bigger parties.  The last time we went it appeared the grill was emitting smoke on one side only and straight into my eye. I moved halfway through dinner and sat next to my friend as she was not receiving any smoke on her side of the table.  Besides that the brisket is one of my favorite items.  They are very fast at bringing all of your items out to you and replenshing the seseame oil!",

                  "review": "We came here on Friday evening; easy parking in back lot behind bank. About a 20 minute wait, which is very good compared to other Korean BBQ. The servers are friendly, they are just rushed & over-worked. The got friendlier when we ordered soju & beers! I think it was $19 each for all-u-can-eat (alcohol not included), and it was worth it.\nHalf-order of squid was 3 huge body pieces, someone else maybe got our tentacles. The bulgogi was great, short rib & beef tongue good, too. My friends said the pork belly was too fatty, huh?! I think the chicken was breast meat, also good. The sides were okay, but not as good as some other places. They had a delicious red spice dipping sauce. Includes steamed rice to which they added the bimbimbap ingredients at no charge. We had no idea they had actual stone dish bimbimbap, which my friends would have happily paid extra. Oh well, next time.\n\nOverall, 4 stars, but probably really 3.75, but I love AYCE KBBQ & it's close to home. We still prefer Oo-Kook in Koreatown, but the drive, the wait, the price....",

I loved the meat it was served fresh. The service was great our waiter was very kind and helpful. We enjoyed every juicy bite of brisket, pork belly and steak. I love their salad here, it's copped up really thin and serves much better than other place that serve the salad sloppy. Our experience was so nice.\n\nI would for sure recommend this restaurant to my friends.\n\nHappy Eating!!\nAt Galbi King",

Kimchi pancake is extra but also really good, usually get it to go.\n\nService is the only thing dragging this place down. Basically, get your order done and dusted in the first go because you won't see a waiter until it's time to pay the bill.\n\nThere's this one snotty trotty guy who snoots around with his nose up acting like catching his attention to get some sides/water is just completely below him.\n\nSort your service out and you'll be a 5* establishment.",

Yes, previous visits aren't the most pleasant but I continued to return because of the all you can eat kbbq, not anymore.\n\nWe asked for our meats and sides several times, we couldn't find \"our\" waiters to assist when we got up to ask because apparently only \"they\" could assist us, but that's not the worst part... I was so disappointed by the LACK of service I tipped a big fat 0 and was confronted about it. One waiter kept asking us how we paid our bill, we explained once, twice, three times until we got the hint that he was not so concerned about how we paid but how much we paid. Overall, we accidentally left a $5 tip and he was asking why we left ONLY a $5 tip. Another waiter jumped in and was even nastier than the first -claiming he only jumped in because he thought we were insulting the other waiter- next thing we knew, the entire restaurant was staring at our \"pay situation\". After we asked to speak to a manager the tall, light skinned, hat wearing waiter claimed he was the manager. When he asked him, again, he said he was just \"going to walk away\" ?!\n\nEverything was so ODD about this situation. Odd!\n\nUltimately, we got the real manager's name by one of the bus boys. I let it go, my cousin on the other hand who is a waitress is deciding to take it to a whole other level. She plans on this entire other scheme with legal violations. We'll see how that goes but prepare yourself if you plan to dine here because you are in for one hell of an experience.",

This place is right off the 405 freeway so it's very convenient. The parking lot is very small so hopefully you can get parking. We got in before the dinner rush so we got seated real quick. It's a small kbbq spot so people may have to wait if it is busy. We got the ayce Kbbq and we got brisket, galbi, and pork belly, and bulgogi\nThe brisket was good, pork belly was alright. Galbi was so so but the bulgogi was sooooo good. Free rice paper, and rice, and service was good as long as you keep reminding them when it's the busy hour. Long story short you are paying 19.95 for good enough ayce kbbq. I'd go back when I'm in the area but if there's more stars in another area try them.",

All day\n\nNeeds Improvement:\n\n- Ventilation... not much of it. Step into a cloud of meat smoke\n- Grill - it's the steel kind which burns up quite quick and needs to be changed more often than it does\n- Service sometimes seems really on top of it, sometimes they just look frustrated with life. Maybe it's the ventilation...\n\nWishful thinking:\n \n- No reservations - I know this is not uncommon but I just wish it were possible\n- No seating for parties over 8 - there might not ever be a way to do this since the whole restaurant is booth seating\n- I wish there were more types of pork belly marinades, like a spicy one that some offer in Ktown",

The meat portions are very generous, decent quality.\n\nTo have a good experience:\n- Avoid peak hours\n- If you go during peak hours, ask for everything up front. They work very hard to get you seated and get everything to you, but spotty after that. Asking for something means a 10 min wait, and they are somewhat forgetful (things we asked for went to the table across us a few times). These guys are *running* back and forth, just under-staffed.\n- The KBBQ comes with an odd Korean salsa and soy mixture; ask for the bean paste and sesame oil when you sit down or they won't bring it to you\n- Get the seafood tofu stew. SURPRISINGLY GOOD, better than Seoul Tofu on Sawtelle.\n- AVOID the beef tongue - very chewy, tough\n- Be prepared to smell like KBBQ. The vents are overhead, not in the grill.\n\nFor those times when Ktown just seems SO FAR AWAY, Galbi king is an excellent place to go, you just have to be proactive making a good experience for yourself.",

                  "review": "For $16.99/person for AYCE kbbq, you might think that's pretty pricey considering we have so many other options in wonderful K-town here in LA. But if you want to stay on the westside and not drive too far, Galbi King is one of the few (if not only..) AYCE kbbq options available.\n\nLet's start with the parking situation. There's a fair-sized lot next door, but many of the spaces are reserved for specific businesses. As a result, you may have a hard time finding a spot! There was a shady security guard when we parked, and you can try to sweet talk him into letting you have a spot as we did. There's a bit of street parking too.\n\nInside, the restaurant is a bit rough on the edges and clearly has some wear and tear. But it's clean enough and the service was really responsive throughout our meal, even with our large party of 8 (mandatory 18% gratuity though, FYI).\n\nFor the AYCE menu, you get a choice of several meats and sides. We enjoyed the short ribs and brisket the most. The short ribs were really tender - be sure not to overcook! The squid was pretty good too, but I'm always wary about grilling squid since it's kind of hard to tell when it's fully cooked through.\n\nFor sides, you of course get a selection of banchan (japchae noodles, spicy cucumbers, kimchi, spicy sliced fish cake, potato salad with apples). You can also order steamed egg, ddukbokki (spicy rice cakes), spicy tofu stew or doenjang (Korean miso) soup, and bibimbap!\n\nThe portion size for the ddukbokki, stews, and bibimbap were really generous and large, but my coworker told us that they just want us to fill up on these dishes instead of the meat. Haha! Perhaps that as some truth to it...\n\nOverall, it was not bad for kbbq though I'd say if you can drive 15 minutes out to K-town, you can probably find better options for the same or cheaper price.",

                  "review": "Here's the gist of the review to save y'all time: If you're too lazy to drive to KTown from the Westside, this isn't the worst choice. But the quality of the overall meal is reminiscent of the $9.95 AYCE in KTown--so essentially you're paying an extra $7.00 for convenience (AYCE at Galbi King is $16.95).\n\nWe came at 7:30pm on a Monday in the midst of their rush. I only saw 3 people on the floor the entire time, frantically running in and out of the kitchen. Having been a server at one point in time, I recognize how crappy it is to be understaffed... so if you want to eat here, I would recommend coming at non-peak hours. I didn't see a \"Help Wanted\" sign so I can only assume that they are chronically understaffed. Seriously though--don't come when it's busy. They never changed out our grill, they never refilled our drinks, we never got the bibimbop or boiled egg or rice cakes that were supposed to come with our other side dishes... we asked for sesame oil, garlic cloves and bean paste as dipping sauces twice over the span of 15 minutes before we received them.\n\nThe meat itself was okay. To their credit, they do bring out a large portion of meat all at once. I wish they provided oiled grills or gave you an onion half or something to stop the meat from sticking... again, this might have been due to the lack of staff. We ordered brisket (chadol), marinated short ribs (galbi), pork belly (samgyupsal) and beef tongue (hyeomit); the brisket and pork belly were decent, but the galbi marinade was sweet and bland and the beef tongue was unbelievably rubbery.\n\nThe only part of the meal I thought stood out was the seafood soon tofu stew, which was surprisingly good and possibly better than Seoul--which is the soon tofu stew restaurant on Sawtelle a mile away.\n\nThe take-away message that I got from eating at this restaurant is that I'd rather drive through traffic to KTown for a good experience than walk here for food that is just okay. I almost gave this joint 2 stars, but I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was just a bad day for service...",

                  "review": "After waiting on the list for an approximate hour and a half, my group of 3 and I were led into a aroma-filled room paced full of people.  Tonight was a busy night for Galbi King and service was pretty spot on.  My only gripes with the service was that our server forgot to bring our squid on the first round AND he literally forgot to bring our check 3x.  He'd pass our table, see us there, and then apologize for not getting the check.  This happened on three consecutive times as he passed our table and gave food to patrons behind us.\n\nOn to the food:  we ordered short ribs, galbi, and squid.  All that we ordered was delicious and on point.  Regarding the ban chan-- I loved the japchae, the potato salad, the rice paper sheets, the salad, the steamed egg and the spicy bean curd.  I had no gut room for the rest of the ban chan and so couldn't sample it, and therefore rate it.\n\nThe experience overall was pretty good and I would return, but most likely for lunch as the dinner wait time was ridiculously long.  Korean BBQ for dinner is never a good idea if you hate waiting in the first place.  This establishment is a godsend since driving to K-Town [on any given time and day] is like driving through a city of blind zombie retards.  I'm always afraid that I may get in a major car crash because people in this area of town can't walk or drive properly.\n\nOh yeah, we sat next to a group who had an annoyingly loud banshee [of a woman] who spoke over the 20 or so people in our area of the restaurant.  She had a filthy mouth and thought too highly of herself.  In case someone gave her the wrong gouge, her sh!t do stink forrealio.  This didn't factor into my 4-star review, but it made the experience a bit less comfortable.  LOOOOUUUDDD NOIIISSESS!!!",

I've heard this place gets pretty packed but luckily the time I went, there was no wait.\n\nIt is ~$17 for AYCE kbbq, the only thing I was really eyeing on the menu was the beef tongue. This place, however, had probably one of the worst beef tongues I've ever had. The flavor was alright but the texture was extremely chewy and off putting. At better kbbq places, the tongue literally melts away in your mouth.\n\nWe got other cuts of meat- kalbi, short plate, brisket, short ribs and everything was pretty good, marinade was tasty. I thought the sides were pretty standard with one exception- the tofu soup. I LOVED it. I've actually never seen tofu soup offered as a side before and the portion was about worth what I usually pay $10 for, maybe a little less but the flavor was spot on.\n\nThis place definitely will make me rethink driving all the way to Ktown for kbbq now- that is if I'm not craving beef tongue.",

The portions here are pretty sizeable. The pork belly and boneless ribs are the best. Bulgogi and chicken can be a bit dry once cooked. The tofu soup is the BOMB.\n\nMy biggest complain is the price. A few months back the AYCE was around $16.99 and is now $19.99. And there's no lunch price either, which struck me as odd since the place is never that full during daylight hours. The place offers a 5% cash discount though, so that is nice if you have the cash or can hit up the Chase next door.\n\nI've generally avoided this place during busy hours so I can't comment to the long waits, but I have just beaten the rush and seen a lot of people waiting for tables. This place should be a bit bigger, imo.",

Only two servers for the whole restaurant. Chubby male server was incredibly rude before we were even seated and continued to give us attitude throughout the night. We had to ask the female server 4 times 20 minutes apart before our rice and steamed egg were finally brought to us after an hour. Both servers cut us off and walked away in the middle of requests. I didn't tip because we basically didn't receive any service the whole night. I could have walked into the kitchen and got the food myself.",

We got the most popular Boneless Short Rib (2nd from the menu), also Spicy Chicken (3rd from the menu). The rib is absolute failure. It's not tender at all and fat everywhere. I could not even chew. The chicken had no flavor, I left the whole tray. I had really good hopes about this place, especially after waiting for such a long time. I have been to many Korean BBQ restaurants, I'm disappointed unfortunately. Sorry. I need to be honest. I won't be coming back. Unless they change their meat quality. Servers are very welcoming.

                  "review": "The quality of the meat here isn't exceptional, but it's good enough considering the popular thing here is cheap, AYCE K-BBQ. It's the only AYCE K-BBQ place on the Westside, but what makes it standout is that the amount of meat is massive compared to other places I've been to. Usually for AYCE they bring out small portions and then provide slow service so I never feel like I get a fair deal. At Galbi King, the waiters bring a large portion of meat and keep checking back to see if you want more. One night after three rounds of different meats, the waiter came back and asked if we wanted more. When we said no, he said it's all you can eat so we should ask for more. We were so stuffed it was impossible, but I was appreciative that they are not stingy with the food here.\n\nThe side dishes and soon doo boo soup are good. My favorite side dish is the potato salad--so good! Refills on any of the side dishes are always provided without seemingly putting out the waiters.\n\nVentilation over the tables is good at exhausting all the BBQ smoke and I like this place when I get a craving for some kalbi or bulgogi.\n\nGreat prices, good service, pleasant waiters, and decent food makes this one of my go-to places when I go out for dinner.",

                  "review": "Came here on a Friday night with my wife.  Due to reports of long waits by others, we called at 7:15 and were told it was only a 10-15 minute wait.  We got there at 7:40 and ended up waiting 45 minutes.  Oh well, most businesses will lowball the wait time over the phone, and I guess this place is no different.\n\nEverything else went great though.  My wife is Korean and we love ayce kbbq.  We've been to various ktown joints often, but anyone living by the 405 knows what a pain it can be going east after work.  Decided to give this place a try.\n\nWe got ayce and found the meat to be just as good as in ktown.  We started with brisket and marinated short rib.  It's true that even if you're a couple, they'll bring you big plates of meat.  In fact they brought the brisket first and just dumped the entire plate onto the grill, so I felt like I was eating as fast as I could just to keep up with all the meat we were grilling.  Luckily I like it that way.  =]\n\nBanchan was great too.  Came out quick and had variety.  The wife is a soup fan (I'm not) and while I was in the bathroom she ordered both soups for us.  That was okay though since I avoid starch to save room at ayce, so I wouldn't have gotten the bibimbap on our first visit anyways.  We also really like how extras such as the rice paper and steamed egg came out without us having to ask.\n\nOur server was a young gentleman and was very nice.  I noticed other tables of customers who were not asian, and they got similarly friendly service from other young waiters.  The busmen were on the spot all night as well.  They don't have the service button that you would see in ktown, but we never had to wait long before seeing a server.\n\nThere's plenty of parking.  Bathroom was clean enough.  We got seconds of the brisket and short rib, so I can't speak to the other meats.  Another reviewer said there's a discount for paying cash, but that was not the case; at least not for us.  Perhaps it's different for regulars.  Overall, ayce for 2, bottle of soju, large bottle of Hite, and one soda came out to about $55 before tip.  We'll be back despite the wait time.  I'd like to try the bulgogi and bibimbap, perhaps when they're not so busy.  Sure beats driving to ktown and back!",

That means due to gas prices and the sheer volume of traffic in this city, I don't like to go anywhere that isn't convenient and it's going to cause me agita on the way there. So for all my fellow Westside dwellers, here is your solution to KBBQ, and it doesn't involve a trip to K-town/Alhambra/the Valley.\n\nGalbi King offers a well stocked, and diverse menu on their AYCE KBBQ. The one caveat here is that everyone has to have KBBQ. No one can have other menu items, so it's ALL or NOTHING. Personally, I have only been (and probably only will ever be) here for the ALL.\n\nThe panchan is always a good spread, and they are not stingy with bringing out additional plates.The potato salad (???) is always my favorite, followed by the tofu skins. I have been here several times with parties of 2,4,6, and 8, and no matter whom we have serving us, they are always pleasant, helpful, and know to keep the Sapporo coming.\n\nThe bulgogi here is DELICIOUS and is always my first and last choice, with brisket, tongue, and whatever I fancy that day making rotations on my plate.\n\nAnd the best part: It's under $20!! Crazy cheap, nice people, and delicious. Sign me up...twice.\n\nHowever, their price and their tastiness is not a secret to those on this side of town, and this place is PACKED on Friday and Saturday nights. Show up early or call ahead, because I've waited over an hour here before, with nothing but my resolve and love of grilled meat to get me through. Any other weeknight though, you're pretty solid. I've never had to wait very long, if at all.",

We got there before the rush, and were not waiting for a table with a grill, so we only waited 10 minutes on a Saturday evening.\n\nThe regular menu is very standard in terms of Korean food.  Prices are not too bad.  The bulgogi was flavored decently, and I really enjoyed their dolsat kimchi bibimbap.  The tofu was pretty standard.  Honestly, I think everything tasted good, but there was nothing that was incredible.  I like the convenience of the location to where I live.  Service was, however, a bit on the slower side.  We had to constantly ask for water refills, side refills, the check, etc. rather than them coming to check up on us.  I also like the fact that they do have AYCE since there are few and far none on the west side.  I will probably come back to try this.",

The rule here is everyone at the table has to eat AYCE - huge bummer!  The carnivores went with $45 BBQ combo for 3 people, which was still a ton of food. The meats were not as fresh nor as well marinated as other KBBQ I've had in the area. The combo also came with tofu soup, which was just flavorless and also lukewarm. We ordered a seafood pancake which was overly greasy. The only reasons I would come back here are for convenience (closer than K-town, ample parking) and cheap if not best quality AYCE.",

There is ample parking in the lot but almost always crowded.\n\nTips:\n1) call and make a reservation ahead of time. Even with a reservation you still may have to wait a little but it cuts it down significantly.\n2) Always ask for the bean paste and the sesame oil, they make a big difference in adding flavor to the meats.\n3) If you are a smaller group, ask for smaller portions so you can taste a bigger variety of meats then go back to your favorites. Otherwise the portions are HUGE:)\n\nMeats:\nIve had the brisket, premium bonus short rib, choice beef short plate, and bulgogi. The Bulgogi is hands down my favorite.\n\nSides:\nLove the Bimbimbap, the sesame glass noodles,  marinated bean sprouts, and spicy tofu soup.\n\nOnly thing that would give this a 5th star is it would be nice to have a variety of sauces on the side to dip my meats in even if they are pre-marinated to give them extra flavor or spice.",

                  "review": "Came here on a Friday night at about 730 and there was a line and about an hour wait. We decided to wait since we were all craving some Korean BBQ.\n\nThe food is obviously all good it's all you can eat meat that you grill yourself. The portions are HUGE. We also got the bibimbap which was very large and there's a bunch of small sides that come along too.\n\nOverall if you want to eat a lot of meat, good kimchi and drink lots of beer/ soju then this is the place for you.",

They gave you so much meat on the first plate, that was all we got to try. They charge you for uneaten food, with the all you can eat option, so you definitely don't want to over order but it would have been nice to try more than one type of meat. I ordered hottie, I never received it, and when I finally was able to get the attention of a waiter again, he brought me tea that was so hot, it no joke would hagiven third-degree burns had I drink it or spilled  it.",

It's small and there was only one server the day we went; poor guy was hustling on a lunch rush so we had to ask for things like more banchan, more little rice wrappers, more water, more napkins, etc. etc. To his credit, he was quick to get them so it wasn't a huge hassle. We gave the dude a big tip for his concerted efforts.\n\nThe food is actually quite decent and tasty. Love the beef tongue and the beef bulgogi. The banchan weren't anything special and the Sapporo was on draft and served icy cold so all good there. At $16.95, this AYCE is a good price for a selection of 6 different meats, including squid.\n\nSo here's the deal: if you don't wanna schlep over to K-Town and NEED to get your KBBQ fix, come here. It's not dynamite, but (to quote a certain movie), \"That'll do, pig, that'll do.\" Oh, and the pork bulgogi was yummy and plentiful.",

Their service was AWFUL and their attitude was even worse and their food quality was only okay at best. When we ordered for anything we waited at least 20 minutes for it. When my boyfriend dropped his pair of chopsticks we had to ask them 2-3 times to bring another pair and after waiting at least 15 minutes I decided to just get up and go ask for a pair at the counter.\n\nAfter the meal we tipped pretty generously for the service that we got. We were a couple cents shy of a 15% tip but as we were leaving the restaurant, one of the waiters had the audacity to chase us outside and demand that we tip more. I'm not sure if he knows what a tip is, but it should  be paid based on service and for the service we were provided, 15% is plenty. I thought that was probably one of the rudest things ever to have happened.\n\nWhether it was the food or the service, the quality was just plain bad.",

Now I don't have to differentiate between \"the one on Sawtelle\" and \"the one on National\" or \"the tofu soup place\" and \"the kbbq place\" when trying to coordinate larger groups of friends.\n\nI wouldn't say the meat is the best I've ever had, but it is pretty darn good and most of the time I'm going to choose this place because it's closer and the food is good rather than driving out to K-Town for a little better quality food.\n\nAlso, make sure if you want AYCE meat that all the other members of your party are also going to order AYCE because Galbi King's rules are AYCE for all or none at your table.",

Brisket looked old and tasted old.\n\nSteamed egg... It came, I got excited, put a whole spoonful into my mouth, and I wanted to cry. It tasted bad. Not all steamed eggs are made equal\n\nPlus note: tofu soup was delicious , full of MSG, but still delicious, with clam and everything.\n\nOverall, good service, good location if you want to avoid the traffic to ktown, and free parking in the back lot.",

They do get one star off because of inconsistent short rib performance. Two times in a row, we got short rib with an old, almost rancid flavor, and you can't have issues with one of the holy trinity of KBBQ meats and get a perfect score. Still, it was on point again the last time we went, and it's as good as any short rib when they get it right. Pork belly isn't my favorite, but they do it well for when I'm in the mood for it.",

                  "review": "Wait: I went to Galbi King on a Monday after work, and the place was PACKED!  There was a 15 minute wait, which isn't bad (I've waited over half an hour before).\n\nParking: Private lot (although many of the spaces are marked for specific stores in the plaza, so you may end up having to street park anyways. I've been told the Ralphs parking lot is safe to park in, and I've parked there myself many times without issue).\n\nCost: $16.95 for AYCE, which comes with Spicy Tofu Soup or Korean MIso Soup. No yummy pancake though :( There are the usual side dishes - Marinated cucumbers, tempura (my favorite!!), bean sprouts, potato salad, kimchi, and steamed egg.\n\nService: SLOW SLOW SLOW :( every time we requested for side dishes to be refilled, we wouldn't get them for 5-10 minutes. If service were faster, I probably would have given Galbi King 4 stars.\n\nFood: The meat came in great heaping plates ( I have a conspiracy theory that this is to prevent you from repeatedly asking the server to refill your plate, but who knows! ). The meat is decent, although I've had better at other joints in Ktown. We ordered the usual - brisket, short rib, and bulgogi, and everything tasted great!\n\nAmbiance: the one thing I CAN say for Galbi King is that it's not smoky inside! I went to Road to Seoul once, and there was smoke blowing in my eyes for the entire hour I was there, and I can safely say you won't have a similar experience here! You'll still reek of meat when you leave, but at least your eyes will be safe :)\n\nGalbi King is a solid choice if you're on the westside, and looking to get some KBBQ yumminess without having to brave LA traffic to Ktown. In fact, it may be your only choice on the westside. Is it better than the equivalently priced places in Ktown? I don't think so - the meat quality isn't as good and there are fewer choices than most of the places I've been to. But it by far trumps any of the $10 places, especially since you get tofu soup too! Personally, I'd splurge on the extra cost (and the extra gas) to get myself to Hae Jang Chon ;)",

I am used to all the Asian restaurants -- and thought the only 2 were Tofu-ya and Seoul Tofu House on the other side of Sawtelle in Little Osaka. Long story short, the service here was meh ... came to get take-out for lunch and was disappointed. The items in their bento box does not look the same as what is given; especially their \"California roll\". Price is standard I think for lunch, but for a lunch special item, I guess it could be a little cheaper? I spent almost $11 on a pork bulgogi bento box and ate about half of it before I threw it away. =T I noticed a lot of people like this place (looking at other yelp reviews + pics) because they have all you can eat kbbq. Given that there are not a lot of korean bbq (let alone ayce) on the westside, I can see this place being a go-to place for it. I don't think I'll be trying it though. I rather drive an extra 7-8 miles to ktwn to get much better service, quality, and price.",

This place has a traditional korean menu, but the traditional food I ordered was really bunk. Maybe it's my fault for ordering soft tofu soup from a normal korean restaurant, but there's no excuse for awful yook ge gang (spicy brisket noodle soup).\n\nMenu was grimey when I got there, called in my order and when I got there, it was obvious it had not been placed. Two slack jawed ktown cowboys working the front register. This place needs a bit of work. Haven't tried their AYCE, which I understand is a good value. This is a review on the quality of the food surrounding your mountain of meat.\n\nInside it's a very beautiful traditional korean restaurant, but I would not say this is a good representation of korean food.",

I called and changed the number of people on the reservation three times and they accommodated that. Half of our group arrived late, it was no problem, they had two big tables (for 8) and one small table held for us. When it's been too long and our last 4 didn't show up, they asked if they could seat someone at that table and we said sure... Then a few minutes later two of them showed up, and the waiter actually asked the two guys sitting there if they were willing to move to another table, so that our girlfriends could be close to us. Sweet!\n\nService in general was fast, we had no problem getting our orders in time, except for a minor confusion over how many people want rice and how many want one kind of miso soup as opposed to another soup. It was all settled quickly and everyone was happy. They did add an 18% gratuity to the bill because it was a large group, which is pretty commonplace, but a heads up so you are not surprised.\n\nThe food was great, we ordered a bunch of things: brisket, short ribs, tongue, bulgogi, pork belly, etc... We passed on the squid and the chicken. The meat was good, I eat mine \"rare\" so nothing tasted dry except the tongue had a chewier texture than it usually does. Overall the food was great.\n\nNow onto the not so good: I asked if they had wine and they said only raspberry wine. The waiter warned me that it was \"very sweet\". I didn't mind, ordered it anyway. I received a smallish bottle of raspberry \"juice\" that didn't taste bad, but hardly resembled wine. It was a one-person serving (regardless of the tiny glasses that came with it... Come on, the alcohol content was 14%!), and for that the price tag was $14, if I remember correctly. That's pretty high compared to the price of the food. Oh well.\n\nOverall a great experience, I will go back again. One more piece of advice: Parking on a Friday night is near impossible in their lot / in the area, I drove around for 10 minutes before parking at a spot I shouldn't have parked in... If you are brave enough, park at the CVS lot across the street and pray that your car will not get towed.",

She has gone here so many times with service being slow but this last time was the worst.\n\nThey ate plate of Kalbi beef;  then asked for another Kalbi Beef plate -- which is what you expect in an \"All You Can Eat\" restaurant.\n\nIt took 20 minutes for them waiting;  and then, after my mother went to the kitchen and asked them if they were \"buying the beef\", the waiter said in a very \"don't care\" attitude and informed her that they were \"busy slicing the beef\"  \n\nWell, don't tell my 82 years old mother that they are taking 20 minutes to  \"slicing the beef\" and just be patient.  She was in the restaurant business (Sushi Restaurants) for over 35 years.  She told them that she can slice it faster with her eyes closed, serve all the customers and ring them up faster than the entire service staff. She wanted to do the \"Show and Tell\" for the service staff -- but luckily my son stopped her.\n\nThen they waited another 20 minutes and decided that was enough;  Really after waiting for 40 minutes to \"slice the beef\" is long enough.  They left and will never return.  \n\nNo wonder they can have the \"All You Can Eat\" since they make you wait an eternity to get the food -- certainly saves money for the restaurant  when the restaurant slows you down the restaurant can save money while you have to wait for the food.\n\nThe name of this place \"Galbi King\", really should be named  \"Galbi Joker\".",

                  "review": "Recommended to me by a friend and I was really excited to try a KBBQ place in the westside so that I don't have to drive downtown or to the Valley but was hugely disappointed. Brought a couple friends who were visiting California and that was a big mistake. The menu for AYCE was larger than what i was used to with more variety of meats and soups that i had not had before (really great) but the service was absolutely terrible. We had to ask multiple times for them to even give us side dishes when they had already brought out the meat, we asked for rice since we sat down and we never saw it as well. Our waters were refilled once by the end of the meal after 3 rounds of meat, I was hesitant after reading other reviews with similar experiences but really wanted to give it a try. It was a thursday night and service was that bad i don't even want to know what it's like when it's the weekend. The food was their only redeeming quality and decent parking. They really need to work on their waiting staff but i will not be coming back, I'd rather drive 30 minutes downtown.",

                  "review": "Let's be real - you'll end up coming here because you don't want to drive to K-Town for quality Korean food and there are only a few choices for KBBQ/soon tofu on the West Side. All You Can Eat is $16.99 and includes bibimbap and other goodies, which is decent.\n\nYES - I do come here for soon tofu. It's not particularly flavorful, but soon tofu's one of my favorite dishes. With the advent of Seoul on Sawtelle, I haven't come here lately. But generally it's between here, Tofu-Ya (Sawtelle), Seoul (Sawtelle), and Asian-Ya (Japanese owned place).\n\nSADLY - the review below saying the AYCE meat is grainy was SPOT ON. I'm not a meat snob at all, but the meat here was flavorless and tough. Even for $16.99 and no KBBQ options in WLA, I still won't do it again. Even cooking the brisket and beef tongue to just past rare (the best way to keep it juicy), it was still tough. The short rib was flavorless as well, and had the strange quality of being roughly the same color raw as it was cooked (dull brown).\n\nYou might say - well, for the price, the meat isn't going to be fantastic. But honestly.. places in K-Town at this price or less are MUCH better. Not expecting grade A cuts here, just something decent. And I would never pay to eat this meat again.\n\nService is pretty awful, with every table in the back room resorting to flagging down the waiters anytime they came by (which was not often). I asked at least three times for certain hidden items (garlic, rice paper), but they never came. Asking multiple times for sauce and water worked, and they're generally good about bringing meat if you can get their attention. But hey - you're not really going to these kinds of places for the service!",

I won't be coming back until they get rid of the very rude waitor whos on the heavier side.  He was so rude to me and my mother last time I went, toward the end of the night it was VERY clear he was ignoring us.  We just wanted to enjoy a KBBQ dinner?!)  I thought it might have been in my head so I suggested to a group of friends that we go to Galbi, but one of my friends said she didn't wanna deal with that guy.  So it's confirmed, we won't be going back, gonna be driving out to KTOWN for our LBBQ from now on!  Food is good there and its farther away from that bitter, rude guy!!!!",

I'd come back here for the price and taste of the BBQ.\nI didn't care for the tofu soup too much. I found it much too thick and frothy on top, lacking in seafood and taste. It was just ok. Got the job done. Nothing outstanding about their side dishes either, just the basics: kimchi, potato salad (creamed? Mashed? Good though), fish cake, and seasoned bean sprouts. A large bowl of cabbage slaw/salad. I was kind of hoping for lettuce and green onions, but the slaw was good too.\nThe service was friendly and in English. A plus. Can't say it was fast but I wasn't in any kind of a hurry.\nA nice find and pleasant first visit.",

Returned it after 2 bites.\n2)  Short rib doesnt taste like short ribs-zero marbling/fat.\n3)  All marinated meats taste the same:  Ginger soy marinate.\n\nHowever, the non-marinated stuff is what you should go for.  You cannot go wrong with them.  Black pork belly and brisket are fresh and delicious.\n\nService:  Not bad.  Should give people quote on timing, but overall it was meeting the expectation of an all-you-can eat Korean BBQ house.\n\nI would rather drive 20 mins to Korean town to get some decent meats and proper kimchi.",

Its not like there's really anything bad about the service, it's just that they often forget to check on you or refill sauces/water/etc. Its not really a complaint,  I just felt it needed to be explained why this place wasn't a 5 star.\n\nEverything else is great here.  The restaurant has a clean comfortable feeling, the waiters are nice, parking is good.  The food, in my opinion, is AYCE quality and for $16.95 all you can eat it is a really good deal.  Their spicy korean style miso soup is always a treat and the meat is always to my liking.  I've been to Hae Jang Chon Korean BBQ in K-Town, which is great in its own way, but I like Galbi King better because of its meat.  Their brisket is very lean and they are one of the few places I've been to that serves white meat chicken breast instead of dark meet.  My gf and I always get the brisket and spicy chicken breast and are usually full after that but we've also tired marinated short rib and the bbq beef.  The short rib is also very lean and tasty while we both felt the bbq beef at Hae Jang Chon was better.\n\nAll in all, this is great place which I have repeatedly gone back to and never been disappointed with the quality of food. Again the service isn't the best but its not bad either.  I definitely recommend this place.",

Be prepared to eat, the AYCE portions are HUGE! We ordered one order of thinly sliced beef brisket and pork belly amongst three girls and we just couldn't eat anymore.  \n\nThe banchan was great -- very fresh -- spicy cucumber, chap chae, potato salad (yum!), fish cakes, and bean sprouts. The steamed egg was spot on and also there was bean paste soup\n\nHere's why this place rocks!\n1. Price ($16.99)\n2, Service (our grill was changed frequently)\n3, Flavor\n4. Portions (biggest ever!)\n5. Convenience and fast\n6. Banchan (fresh!!)\n\nNote: I am so embarrassed but I am really bad at math and shorted the waiter on his tip a bit! If he reads this (tall korean guy --very nice -- please reach out to me so I can give you the proper tip!)",

I've read reviews calling the service slow and/or rude, I don't find this to be true. They're very busy from the minute they open till the time they close, so they're not going to stop at your table a chat like some places. They take you order, usually the second you sit down, and then they get your food. Simple as that. They'll check on you a few times, but it's not the kind of place where your waiter is going to hover. I've also read reviews complaining about them not sitting or take your name after 8:30 even though they close at 9:00, which is the most ridiculous thing I've read on here. It makes complete sense to me that they would stop setting people in a respectful amount time before closing time in order to allow the costumers to enjoy the AYCE BBQ without being rushed. Cooking the meat at your table takes time and considering its AYCE most people do more then one round of meat. I've tried to go close to the cut off and been turned. I was sad because I was craving it, but understand their policy and respect it. I just went the next day to get my fix.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it's my favorite spicy tofu soup I've ever had! The AYCE BBQ has excellent meats at a very fair price. I always get the same things, so I can't say I've tried everything but the brisket, bulgogi, and short ribs are terrific! My boyfriend and I go about twice a month (sometimes every week) always on Sunday. We try to get there when they open because anything after that, you will have to wait. With that being said, if you do have to wait it's totally worth it!!",

The food here is alright, I always go for the AYCE buffet which cost 17$ or so and always left the place stuffed.\n\nI do get stomach ache sometimes because I couldn't wait for the meat to be fully grilled (always came here empty stomach for the buffet). Service is always good; never had a problem with them yet.\n\nLoved their beef tongue though. Wanted to give a 4 but there's something quite missing (friends keep on telling the one in korea town are miles better) but I would still come here if im hungry.\n\nPlace can be crowded during peak hours, be prepared to wait for seats.",

On top of that, they OD all the meat with marinade. It just ain't right guys :'( You can't call yourselves a KBBQ place when the food don't taste Korean no more. If this was a fast-food Korean joint, then SURE, but for a sit-down restaurant? NO. (thinking about it the quality's similar to Gushi's)\nAnd, the only decent meat on the menu is the pork belly... but pork's always the cheapest meat on AYCE menus?? = no point in ever coming here.\n\nThe only reason why I'm even giving this place 1 freaking star is because the sole waiter there was a sweetheart.",

We checked Yelp and found that we were only a couple miles away and we figured we'd chance it and give them a try.\n\nWe arrived at about 8pm on a Friday night. As long as we didn't care if we had a grill at the table, the wait was only 3-5 minutes. TRUE.\n\nWe were seated in a corner table and had the waiter there immediately to take our drink order. We had just put our menu's down when he arrived with our drinks and then took our order.\n\nOur appetizer ( fried wontons ) arrived quickly. When we asked for soy sauce, a ginger sauce was served instead...while mildly irritating, turned out a better choice anyway. It was very flavorful and complimented the wontons well.\n\nNine side dishes were served and were standard fare...nothing special and seconds not offered.\n\nThe main course was Bulgogi. VERY flavorful, decent portion and well appreciated.\n\nThe only real irritant was the noise. The ambient noise level was short of a minor riot. Not much can be done to quiet it down due to the large number of customers in such a confined space, and block walls.\n\nWill we return? Yes! It's far more important to us to get great food at a reasonable cost, than to be concerned with the noise...I can always bring earplugs...",

My non-Korean friends thought it tasted fine and are frequent visitors. I probably won't be back for another year or so until I decide to give it a second try.",

                  "review": "This is one of those, \"I'd like to give it 3 1/2 stars,\" scenarios.\n\nGalbi King was one of the first restaurants I dined at when I moved to Los Angeles in August. I'm always searching for a good Korean eatery, and even more-so for an all-you-can-eat place. Galbi King is a Korean BBQ establishment in an unassuming location off I-405. The owners recently split from neighboring restaurant, Tofu Ya, and was renamed to avoid confusion. I came here on a moderately-busy weekend afternoon with a few old friends, and even made a new friend in the process. See, food brings people together!\n\nNew cohort, James, took the lead, recommending that we do the 'All You Can Eat BBQ' for a modest $16.95. Included with the meal is a variety of Korean side dishes aka Banchan (I counted roughly 8, which is about the average), simple salad, choice of soup (they're hailed for their spicy 'soon tofu'), and a variety of meats ranging from Black Angus Brisket to beef tongue. Everything you choose can be ordered as frequently as you finish them.\n\nThe Banchan were typical, garden-variety kimchee, pickled bean sprouts, daikon radish, and fish cakes; nothing too memorable, aside from the potato salad banchan, which was quite unique. We started with the salad and the tofu stew- the first round of stew was mistakenly ordered as regular, with the second and third helpings ordered as 'spicy'; a night-and-day difference. Pretty good start.\n\nNext was the first round of meat: brisket and pork belly. The brisket was good, although I'm normally a fan of slow-cooking this cut of meat instead of just simply bbq-ing. The pork belly was lacking in flavor and plain overall. After a round of each we moved on to the boneless short rib and bulgogi. The short ribs had a good mix of fat:meat ratio, and the bulgogi was good when accompanied with a small portion of rice.\n\nAmongst the four of us, we polished off 3 salads, 3 soups, a hefty serving of reload-able banchan and rice paper wraps, and approximately 10 trays of meat . Not bad for a few hours of work! The total came out to around $88+ tax and tip, or $22 each.\n\nI recommend: 1.) arriving during non-peak hours 2.) ordering the spicy tofu stew 3.) exploring different cuts of meat 4.) bringing an empty stomach, and maybe some sweatpants if you're a serious eater like us. This meal both satisfies and punishes, as you will inevitably submit to your gluttony in payments of innumerable groans, shifting of seating position, and belly aches during the trek home. What Galbi King lacks in overall originality, it tentatively makes up for in portion sizes.\n\nIn short, Galbi King is a good place to eat when you have a voracious appetite, and if the $22 price tag is worth the 12-hour digestive marathon your stomach will run.",

We start off by standing there for 5 minutes while the host walks by us with no greeting multiple times.. he finally has the decency to say something and yells at us cause we looked confused while we're looking at his menu. I ask him to repeat himself and he says \"are you here to cook the food on the table or not?!\" As I trying to comprehend what that means, he storms off. If my girlfriends mom wasn't with us, I guarantee that it wouldn't have been a pretty sight. But I let it slide and we just walked out. Sucks for them cause that restaurant missed out on at least $80 just because they had a rude host/server. I would highly recommend you to avoid this place.",

From the servers to the husky host, I was thinking this was one of the best KBQ restaurants to go too, but it took one bad host, the flamboyant host with glasses that changed everything. He was very rude and prejudice. His customer service was very bad and on top of that, he assumed since we were a group of color, we wouldn't tip so he took it upon himself to take the tip out of our credit cards with out asking for our permission. If it wasn't for this one host, skinny w glasses I would have given this place 5 stars I recommend no one to come here to eat if your of color, black or Hispanic avoid at all cost!! there are way better KBBQ restaurants in L.A",

I am not a hard core meat eater, so I usually don't feel the desire to order the AYCE unless we're taking out friends who go for that type of thing. Plus, we like left overs. So my hubby and I tend to go for the combos which easily feeds us both twice. The banchan is okay, but they used to serve a sesame broccoli side dish that was great. Now its down to potato salad, pickled cucumbers, kimchi, bean sprouts, fish cakes, and glass noodles. Nothing spectacular but still a solid variety.\n\nThe hubby and I both get our combos with bulgogi--I get the beef, he gets the pork, but really he gest both and I steal his tofu soup. They skimp on the white rice and its a gamble as to whether they will charge for a refill or not.\n\nThe tofu soup is brimming with clams and beef with a few strategically placed prawns. If you can handle it-- order spicy. It seems that they changed their spice meters. Medium used to be the spicy. SO I unwittingly ordered medium and wondered why things were so bland. I realized they added an \"Extra spicy\" option and toned all the others down, so order one level up from your usual and you will be happier.\n\nTends to always be busy, but the wait isn't bad. They also give a discount for paying with cash.",

                  "review": "If you want a deal, this is the greatest KBBQ on the westside, and a great\nAYCE choice overall.\n\nThis used to be joined with a restaurant called Tofuya, but has been renamed.  I've only been once since the renaming, but nothing has changed, so my review below from Tofuya still stands:\n\nFood:  AYCE = All You Can Eat.  I don't remember the price, but I think it was under $20 per person at night.  I believe you can choose non-AYCE, but WHY??!?!!  The food is mediocre Korean BBQ.  That means they bring you plates of meat and you cook it yourself on grills built into the table.  (Btw this isn't buffet styled).  In addition to the wide selection of side dishes (bachan) that they'll serve, the AYCE also allows you to order other korean dishes - like korean rice bowl, tofu bowl, steamed egg, salad, etc.  None of it is amazong, but you get decent food and insane variety.\n\nService:  Average, but mostly because they tend to be understaffed.  The servers do try, they're just usually spread too thin...\n\nPrice:  Already mentioned, I think it's around $20, which means insane value especially for those stomaches that can go the distance.\n\nThe Rest:  Attached parking lot for convenient free parking.  Open late hours.  Takes CC.  Plays shitty asian music (mostly Japanese when I was there).  :)  Yah, screw the ambiance, enjoy the practicality and the great food!\n\nConclusion:  Basically, I was ecstatic to find such a Korean BBQ joint in the area, and you should be happy too.  Some people actually complain about paying $20 for kbbq, but this is the westside, not ktown, and the quality is certainly there.",

The meat is all pretty good quality and we usually end up getting the brisket, beef tongue, and of course the calbi.  We had the bulgogi once and it was just meh.  Don't waste your time with it.  The beef tongue is sliced super thin and is surprisingly tasty.  And they don't call themselves Calbi King for nothing.  The calbi is nice and marbleized and super flavorful.  It's my FAVORITE.  In fact, I think I got into a fight with my fiance for cooking it last the last time we went.  I was getting too full to really enjoy my precious calbi!\n\nThe banchan (little Korean side dishes) also deserve a mention.  They give plenty (salad, potato salad, fish cake, kimchi, pickles, bean sprouts).  They are also generous with the rice paper and will give you more if you ask for it.  \n\nSooooooo good! Can't wait to come back and stuff my face with meat!!!!!!\n\nMy only negative observation about this place is that they don't have the Korean doorbells at the table and it can be difficult to flag someone down for refills of water or more rice paper!",

As soon as you walk in they welcome you and take your AYCE KBBQ order right away. They check in on you to make sure you have all the Banchan you want and that your meal is going well. They are all very sweet. The price is $16.99 for AYCE and you have about 8-10 meats to choose from. You can taste the freshness and how delicious the meat is. Your AYCE meal comes with your choice of soup, we always choose Spicy Tofu Soup (reminds me of Soon Dobu). I was hesitant because I live in Ktown and never thought a place outside would be this good! I recommend this place to a lot of friends! Also, there is a private lot parking for FREE!",

Those can make or break a dining experience, in my opinion.\n\nAmple parking, we were seated right away by 8:30 PM, and ordered ASAP. We got four buffet meals, and ordered chicken, beef, bulgogi (sp?), and another meat- rib roast or something like that? The very thinly sliced meat. Our waiter was friendly and whenever we asked him for additional side refills, rice, or another plate of meat, he came pretty quickly, or even if we flagged down another waiter, they were just as fast and cordial.\n\nWe also got a side order of fried dumplings which were delicious! They had a thin crispy skin, not soggy or anything, and the filling was very tasty! I ate it with the salad they offered, and that pretty much held me over until the chicken came and we finished cooking it. The meat platters are very hearty and I personally think you get your money's worth. My father loved the tofu, kimchi, and jap jae (sp?) noodles, and my sister was a huge fan of the egg souffle type of thing, even though I didn't care for it.\n\nLastly, the bathrooms are simple, no frills, but clean, no smells or urine spills, no toilet paper lingering on the ground, good dim warm lighting ( a plus for me, just a random quirk), soap in the dispenser, paper towels available, and PLENTY of toilet paper. Seriously, there was a shelf rack in the rather large bathroom FULL of extra toilet paper rolls. I guess there will never be any chance of running out, eh?\n\nOverall, a good stop before the airport, quick fast service, friendly waiters, and hearty food for my family. : )",

We were served heaps of meat for all you can eat but we couldn't even finish it (and we usually do). You can tell they work really hard and have great service for suh a busy place. The marinades of the meats are on the sweeter side, and so are their sauces, but overall a pretty good deal. It was our first time last night and I'll definitely be back.\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool",

                  "review": "3 photos\nMy boyfriend and his friends were raving about this place so I decided to tag along. They said the portion sizes were huge, it was cheaper than other KBBQ places we've been too, and it's much closer to us than driving all the way to K-town!\n\nWe arrived at 6:30PM on a Monday evening and had to wait a few minutes for a table. By the time we left around an hour later there were 3 or 4 parties waiting to be seated. The restaurant is small with maybe 15 tables total.\n\nTo begin with we ordered soon dubu, 2 orders of brisket, short plate beef, and beef tongue. I didn't realize how crazy the portions are here until the waiter brought us a heaping plate of brisket. But I've been to KBBQ with these guys countless of times and knew they could easily eat through all the meat.\n\nSadly, this is where my expectations of Galbi King took a turn for the worse. The restaurant uses a metal grill, which is technically healthier for you than charcoal. However, it also means the meat doesn't taste as good. I am not an expert on meat quality but I didn't think the meat here tasted as good as it does at places like Manna and Moodaepo. In fact, everything we had didn't seem up to par with the more expensive KBBQ places we've been to. Everything from the soon dubu, side dishes like the potato salad and fishcake, and even the sauces were just not as tasty as most other KBBQ restaurants. I mean how hard is it to serve sesame oil w/ salt? It almost seemed like the oil had been watered down. Also, there aren't very many options of meat to choose from. They offer the basics, bulgogi, chicken, brisket, beef tongue, etc. but if you're looking for more exotic options, they definitely do not have that here.\n\nAll in all, this place is OK. You only pay $16.75 for AYCE at Galbi King. However, I would rather pay a few dollars extra for higher quality and better tasting food all around.",

Love. love. LLOOOOVVEE. As soon as the weather starts cooling down I CRAVE this stuff like no other. This place is open later than Tofu Ya, so I was able to call in an order for some late night munchies.\n\nI ordered the dumpling tofu soup and was able to drive over and pick it up about 10 minutes later. I was given a pretty large bowl of soup, all of the typical banchan (kimchi, cold noodles, etc.), and rice. Everything was YUMMM. Not as amazing as BCD (alas, why are you soo far away from my apartment), but on par with Tofu Ya and some of the places in SGV. It was a little pricey (~$11) but so it everything else on the Westside. The guy who helped me out was very nice and the whole transaction was quick & easy!\n\nWill definitely be back for my quick Korean tofu soup fix!",

We went there to celebrate a friend and didn't want to order until all of our friends arrived.  The waiter (possibly one of the owners) asked us to start ordering. Otherwise, we would have had to leave the table to other customers. Thus, we ordered. A couple of hours later the same waiter asked us to leave because \"the restaurant had a policy of not allowing customers to stay for more than 2 hours!\" There were no customers waiting at that time. Finally, they included the tip in our check without even informing us about that. In general, all the staff was rude and didn't care about the customers' needs. Will never ever go back there again! They don't even deserve 1 star.",

Now the customer service. That's the real reason this place got a 1 star. So when we first got there, they were okay, I can tell they were busy so I wasn't too worried about a crazy good service. I noticed that they were being rude to other customers thought not us though ... At least at first. When we were seated I sat NEXT to my boyfriend, but when things were being brought out they kept putting it across the table. The guy took our order and that was that. I say \"the guy\" because he did not say his name or anything like that. Our meat came out fairly quickly. We ordered rice and after the meat came we had to wait for the rice for so long I asked the guy for our rice and he said \"yeah it's coming\" and walked away. Eventually we did get the rice. The guy did not stop to see if we're doing okay or wanted to order more or anything. I ran out of water several times and had to ask someone else for water! When I asked him it took me a lot longer to get it. We were so fed up with the service we just wanted to get out of there. We asked for the check about 3 times before it was finally give to us. When it was hang to us, the guy said something quickly and walked away. I had such a terrible experience I honestly did not feel they he deserved a tip so I didn't leave anything but the change. As we were leaving, although we did have a bad experience I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was because they were \"busy.\" But as we walked to the car, and was about to pull out of the lot one of the waiters come out with a attitude saying, \"can you guys at least leave a 10% tip\" A tip is extra money that I DONT have to spend. The fact that he went out of his way to find us and ASK for a better tip I found rude. Why should I tip when I had to chase down the service. I paid for the food that I ate. Coming from Vegas were every K BBQ you go to is busy (I would say at least 10x busier then this place) and many places still manage to give amazing service. Here's a TIP for them, I understand the how busy it is, but I'm sure people would not mind waiting a little bit longer for a great EXPERIENCE. Because it's not just about the food, also the experience!",

The food quality has declined over the years.  I recently ordered Galbi beef to go and oh boy I felt cheated. For $16, I was given nine pieces.  They used to have a decent portion but not anymore.  Well, needless to say, I was craving Korean and it's the closest place in my neighborhood.  I thought I give them another chance and ordered the Galbi beef. Eight pieces!!! That's probably equivalent to two strips.  \nNo more.  Over priced for the portion.",

I don't think I will be going here anymore\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\n1/21/2013Previous review\nThe fact you can get bibimbap and soon tofu as part of their AYCE is one of my favorite perks.  I generally don't care for rice, but it's bibimbap damn it, so I splurge when ever I do go here.  Cuts of meat are decent (it's AYCE, it's never going to be super high quality)  but their boneless choice beef rib, which is thin sliced like brisket is pretty damn good.  They have two types of grills here as in the actual grill piece not the gas powered part.  And one of them the meat sticks to it pretty bad.  Other than that the grill works really well, adjustable and what not.\n\nThe staff here is very nice.  All male staff (not like it matters, I'm here for the food) but they are all soo friendly.  I've been here a few times now and the staff is starting to know me better, so they are extra friendly now.  But I never had an issue before.",

Its not as cheap as the Korean BBQ's in Koreatown, where there is a super-saturation on the market, but its not as expensive as the places nearer the water.  For 17 bucks, your all you can eat ticket has additional items that the cheaper 9-12 dollar places do not have, which is great, but if you're a bulgolgi and brisket junkie like me, you're paying extra for items you don't really need.  This place isn't set up well for big groups at all, so if you're eating with more than 5-6, there is nowhere to sit together.  We had 8 last time we went there, and had to sit on opposite walls with four in each booth.  Maybe it was understaffed, but despite it being rather slow, it was also rather slow service each time I've visited there too.  But I love meat, and there is no other Korean BBQ's near this area, so I will go back.",

Me and my friend went on Saturday which was a little busier than usual. we signed our name on the list and left our phone number in case they couldn't find us when it was our turn to go in.  Then the worker seated down a group that was behind us in line before us, and I asked very nicely why they were seated before me.  he had a horrible attitude and said that they will let me sit as soon as possible.  when I finally sat down, he came to our table and starting telling me that I don't have the right to ask him about the waiting list, because he works there and he knows better than me.  I then stated that I have the right to ask a question, then he said he has the right to refuse service to me.  then he yelled saying \"SO ARE YOU GOING TO EAT OR NOT\" I then ordered something, and then before he walked away  he said If you complain to any of the workers ever again, you can't eat here anymore.  so right when he said that we got up and left.  he was extremely rude and disrespectful.  I do not recommend eating here, because of the horrible service, and the disrespectful staff member.",

We could have just walked out without paying, but instead gave them no tip. I have never in my life given 0 tip to any restaurant but this has been the worst experience ever!\n\nThis is supposed to be all you can eat bbq, we ordered 4 kinds of meat initially and only got 3. We asked for the 4th meat but was constantly ignored by one of the server, the other one was asked 3 times and even the busboy was asked to follow up twice, we waited for more than 30 mins, no meat came out. What ticked me off, was they asked the table behind us if they needed more meat, when we weren't asked at all and we constantly followed up on our order but never got any! We saw other tables getting more meat and checked on when we were ignored the entire time as if we never existed! They offered drinks in the end and also a cooked short rib meat but we lost our appetite already! We brought my sister for the first time hoping she would get a wonderful experience but got otherwise! I do not recommend this place at all, if you want to enjoy a nice AYCE meal, this is definitely not the place!",

The meat is obviously low quality and chewy but I was willing to let that all go and come here regularly because the service we received from Carlos was always amazing. Went there today, was served by cali who is the owners wife and won't be going back because of the way she treated me. They have a all you can eat lunch buffet which has a small bowl of tofu soup on it. I ordered one, finished it and asked for another, she wouldn't give it to me even though it is clearly posted on their ALL YOU CAN EAT menu. Her explanation was that some times large groups come in and people order more than one soup each, so they now only do one soup per guest (but they haven't posted anything about that on their menu). I don't know about you, but all you can eat means all you can eat to me. You can order all the meat you want, so i ordered another round of meat. She literally lost a good customer over a $3 bowl of soup on a menu they offered. If it's too expensive for them they should either stop all you can eat menus or raise their price. But once they advertise something they should honor it. Her behavior made me feel that they aren't a trustworthy restaurant and I wouldn't eat at a place I couldn't trust. There are simply better restaurants near by that you can go to and not feel ripped off when you leave... over a small bowl of soup...",

It was recommended to us by an old co-worker. The place is pretty simple and somewhat small. The meat they have is good. I've been to K-town KBBQ and I would say it's along those ranks. I LOVE the steamed egg!!!! ^_^ (asian happy face). The staff are nice, but they're not very efficient. It takes SO long to get someone's attention/service. If you're there on a saturday night, make sure you flag the bus boy who gives the drinks, he's pretty helpful and nice. We usually give him a separate tip because he's the one that attends to us the most. You would think it would be the server but they're pretty busy running around like chickens with their head cut off. I feel bad on how inefficient they are. :/",

                  "review": "Last night was my first time at Galbi King, I was there with a large group so we had to get two tables.\nIt is a shame I have to give this place two stars. Some of the food was actually very good, more about that later. The reason for the two star review is the service and the experience. Our server was just slow and rude, we would be talking to him and he would literally walk away mid sentence. I'd never seen anything like it. Also our table had little flies flying around every where, landing on side dish, the table, in cups of water.  It was really annoying and gross, we should have asked for another table but we didn't. We just sat there killing them as they landed. We were sitting next to the waiter station so I am not sure if that had something to do with it but either way it should not be accepted.  Based on the flies alone I am not sure if I will ever give Galbi king another try.  Which is a shame.\n\nMy group came for the AYCA, which is a great price for the what you get.  \n\nThe tofu soup was great and spicy, and all the sides were good too, I loved the Kim chi, been sprouts, and the noddles.\n\nFor our meats we tried to try everything.\n\n-The short ribs and Bulgogi were amazing, I could have eaten just those two items and be completely satisfied. By far my two favorite items of what we ordered. The flavor and the marinate was so good and the meat was juicy. If I do ever visit again these two items will be 90% of my order.\n\n-The Brisket was a bit of a disappointment, it just lacked flavor, if I did not coat it with hot sauce it would of been like eating flavorless meat.\n\n- The squid was good, very spicy, which I did not mind. A bit chewy and hard to eat but I guess that is to be expected with grilled squid.\n\n- The beef tongue was also tough and chewy, more then I expected from it. It had a strong beef flavor, again more then I remember from other times I've eaten it.\n\n-The pork belly was decent, it lacked the flavor I was hoping for.\n\n- By the time the it came to ordering the spicy chicken I was getting full so I did not try any of it.  (I'm also not a fan of chicken breast)  The people who did try it said it was good and also spicy.\n\nOverall, if the service got better and they got rid of the fly problem I'd consider going back to give it another shot.",

At 9:35 pm they did last call everything even drinks. Which they never even asked us what we wanted to drink so we were stuck with water. Once we got our meat the check came and the waiter came back  to grab the check and since we did not sign it yet he started picking up. He came back again and said its 10 pm so please hurry and eat (he did say it nicely). They should not sit anyone after 9pm if they have a cut off time at 9:35pm. We didnt get what we wanted and were rushed out. Paid $40 buck for nuthin. Not good food not good service not good time. Not going again.",

Someone mentioned the marinade being too much but I (and my husband) loved the marinaded items (Galbi/short ribs & Bolgogi).  The brisket is not marinated at all and is also very good.\n\nTheir bibimbap (colorful rice dish) is very good, too - not too spicy but enough to give it a kick. Of course, they serve the sauce to go with it if you want to kick it up a notch or two.\n\nThe line is kind of ridiculous on the weekend but its not too bad during the week (although some days it is just as crowded as the weekend).\n\nIf you're looking for good Korean BBQ and don't want to take the drive to K-Town or spend a ton of money, this is the place to go!",

AYCE for only $16.99 that comes with all the extras such as soondobu, salad, steamed egg, rice, bibimbap, etc. I don't think they even have all these included in K-town restaurants. My friend and I ordered the brisket first, and intended to try out many different types of meat they had on their menu. Except they brought us enough brisket to feed an army and then some. We didn't even order anything else and could barely finish that enormous heaping platter of brisket. Tip: if there's only two people, ask them to give you a reasonable portion so that you can order a wide selection of meats.",

We literally had to flag our server down every second for him to come to the table. We sat there for so long before he even came over.

I waited for about 30 min to get seated, which was okay because it was dinner time but when my family and I sat down, I was given the meat in which the waiter cooked the food for us without even asking. He cooked it at another empty grill next to us. Not even our own grill. He thought he was doing us a favor but the meat was cold and rushed. Since it was closing time, they were just rushing to leave and pack up so they tried \"helping\" us. Nevertheless I am never going back to this place again!!!!",

I go because it's around the corner and closer than Ktown, but not very often because it's a little pricey. If it were a little more affordable I would eat here often and do more than the AYCE.",

The meat is similar to that of many other KBBQ places but the soup is where this place shines. Their tofu soup is by far the most legit out of all the KBBQ places I've been to! Its like this place specializes in making them!\n\nNow comes the bad. The place is fairly small so it does take awhile to get seats if you have a big party. My biggest issue and the reason for giving 1 star is because of the waiter there. I went on a random Tuesday night and there was not much people there so the waiters were not super busy running around or anything but yet they still managed to require me asking four times before we got water and our grill changed. I like to be polite and give people time so each time after asking, I waited a good 8-10 minutes at least. However, they are a bit unreasonable that night. To top that off, when my friends and I left, one of the waiters ran out and stopped us when we left to ask if we forgot to tip! Clearly we did not since there was tip there, so it was obvious that he wanted more tip, and for that kind of service, it was not warranted. Hesitantly, we gave a few more dollars after explaining that the service was just not satisfactory.",

He provided no explanation and smiled as my brother confoundedly left the restaurant. This is extremely unfortunate, as this has been one of our favorite spots for KBBQ. I'm giving them a high rating because My aim is not to destroy the reputation of the restaurant, rather I want to communicate to them that this waiter (early 20s, and (from prior experiences with him) is unprofessional, disorganized and disrespectful. His further employment ought to be considered carefully.",

I had a new Hispanic person helping me out through  the night with my family he was amazing. Even though it was crazy full he was very attentive with us. I'm one to give tips in a all you can eat restaurants exclusively to those who help me! At the end of the night he deserved it . When I finished paying an Asian man with glasses and with a kinda long bowl cut hair tells me I haven't tip yet. I told him I'm not leaving I know. I proceed to give the tip to the person that help me out, but he tells me don't bc they take it away from us! I mean I thought the worse thing that can happen is that they split it but he states they take it away from them!!!! I ended up putting the tip by a water hoping the guy that help me out got it! We end up getting up and walking away. The Asian guy ends up rushing following my brother harassing him for tip (he's only 13). My brother confused gives him his allowance money scared not knowing what is going on. He ends up telling my brother not to come back. I see what happens and tell the guy he doesn't deserve the tip the guy in the blue shirt does. And he beings to say \" blue shirt stole tip!!\" I told him not did u see the table the tip is there I informed him he's getting a bad yelp review and he says never to come back. I rather got to Korea town and pay the same amount for way better food and a place where I see that there's no discrimination. This is not only my worse experience, but my brothers!!!",

I'm disappointed that the quality of their food has changed; I have to admit for the quantity of food, you are definitely getting a great deal, but one will be sacrificing the quality. The panchan used to be a lot more authentic while the meat was marinated acceptably; but now the meat is over powered by sweetness and so is the panchan without the true base of a key ingredient used in almost all Korean foods:  sesame oil and seeds. I have to give them credit that they still \"got it\" when making the soondobu soup which was delicious, but unfortunately I have to mark this three stars overall. Although understaffed, the waiter was very nice and accommodating.",

                  "review": "the food is reasonable for the price (all you can eat). I did not like the bimbibop at all though... save your money and don't order that because it's an additional fee. My lower rating is mostly because of customer service. They are just plain rude here and there is no other way to say it. I have been here a few times (mainly because of price and convenience of location) but every time have had an experience with rude waiters, hosts, etc.\n\nMy most recent experience: walked in at 9:20 pm and put my name down (I was the only one waiting for a table). At 9:24 the waiter comes to me and says \"You know we close at 10 right?\". I won't even go into why that is obnoxious... I think it's self explanatory. Although I was irritated by his comment, I politely told him I did know that and my other party would be here in just a minute. I proceeded to follow him but he was looking at me kind of strange so I asked if my table was ready and he said \"not yet\". SO THEN WHY EVEN TELL ME THEY CLOSE AT 10???? NOT MY FAULT A TABLE IS NOT READY. CHANGE YOUR TIME TO CLOSING AT 9 IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE EARLY!!!!\n\nThen we sit and we are rushed (because they clearly want us out by 10... FYI people when a restaurant closes at 10 that generally means the last person is seated at 9:45). We order our items and order a vegetable bimbimbop (and actually asked the guy what was inside it). It arrives with MEAT in it. We politely tell him we ordered veggie. He proceeds to tell us it is just a little meat on the side and that's how they come. I stayed quiet while my other party explained that he told us it came with veggis.. He then said it comes with veggies and a little meat but he would take it and change it (with attitude and i'm certain a little spit in it if we chose to do that). I then opened up my mouth and said \"your menu shows you have a veggie one\" He then said again he would take it and change it and we asked him to just take it out. Then he kept asking us what else we would like so we asked what time we had until to keep ordering and he said \"5 more minutes so it's the same as ordering now\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME????\n\nAnyway, I could go on but I won't... so all in all, if you want to go here, by all means go right ahead. Try to get there at least 2 hours before cloasing... you might get better attitudes. Don't expect the best meat int the world... it's just okay. The short ribs had a meaty flavor to it (this is the second time I have experienced that). I know that sounds odd since it is \"meat\" but I guess i like \"steak\" type taste. All in all though, the boys who run this place need to learn a thing or two about politeness and customer service. If they are too tired then hire a few more employees so they can take a break and have a better demeanor... also consider changing closing time. That's my recommendation for them!",

                  "review": "Recently went here after a great friend recommend this place. However, to my standards this isn't great at all the meat is far below basic besides the marginated meat and to top that off there service doesn't meet my level. I understand a small location, but when its taking 7-10 just to bring out water to my table thats awful. Also, when I went about 50% of the tables were dirty and still had plates on them and again they didn't seem like they knew what customer service meant. Lastly, what I read on the menu stated $20 bucks all you can eat korean BBQ (that price itself was a bit overpriced for the restaurant status and service) on top of that they added a tip to our checks of a party of 2. Never have I been forced to pay for a tip on such a small party it wasn't listed on the menu only said on a party of 6 or more you will charged a tip. I told the manger and he said the owner charged everyone but, I really did expressed my bad experience and even then he made me pat tip. NEVER SHALL I come here to eat Korean BBQ way over priced $26 bucks per person isn't worth it.",

So I've been away at college for like a month and the first place I wanted to stop by was Galbi King, and I was really disappointed with the changes. They raised the prices, they only allow the check to be split (max) 2 ways, they now put a 2 hour time limit on sitting at your table, AND (the most annoying) they have different prices for people paying in cash or (credit/debit) cards. The card and cash policy wasn't posted anywhere or told to us until after we received the check. I wouldn't mind the charge of it was a matter of cents but the difference (for our check at least) was almost $7. The place is fine, but I found these new changes to really trashed it down. The waiter was also a jerk, he only had 3 tables (including us) and was very irritated by any request that was made. I wouldn't go back again.",

We were seated about a half hour later. Waiters were clearly short-staffed, but were all super friendly and tried their best to cater to the full restaurant. I ordered the beef soon tofu and bibimbap combo. The order was HUGE. I barely finished a little more than half of my soon tofu (and I'm a big eater!). I tried to finish it because it was so yummy, but couldn't. I had to take my entire bibimbap home and had it for breakfast AND for lunch the next day. Definitely not good for a diet, but I will likely return when I'm in the mood for stuffing myself with delicious Korean food. For less than $20 (tip included), I had enough food for 3 meals. Totally worth it. Friends recommend coming back for the all-you-can-eat... But I have yet to try it. Seems like an enormous amount of food and great for big guys with big appetites.",

The $20 tier offers basic meats and my party left full. My mom never had Korean BBQ before so she decided she would try it and this was closest place to her. She had a lot of fun and is now a Korean BBQ lover, SUCESS! The sides were also good. 5 stars for what it was, could there be more meat choices for the all you can eat, sure, but they do have other fixed tiers for those wanting more variety. The only down part was when we got there there was no approximate wait time. Luckily we were seated in about 20 minutes. It's no different than any other small all you can eat places. You have to wait for when the other people are finished. Which could be problematic for elderly people or those who have issues with standing. There is a place to wait outside and sit but we got there when it was raining. But overall great experience and it got my mom trying and loving new things!!!",

About a half hour finally a guy noticed us and asked \"are you guys done\" When we said no he seemed so upset and said\"oh my god!\". This made you very uncomfortable!!!! Won't come again!!",

We travel far to enjoy good Korean food from the bimbimbap, to the trendy BBQ, to soon Tofu.  High quality to very generous portions make this place exceptional.  We very much appreciate the servers too and the help who picks up the dishes.  They know us by our first names and really go the extra mile to make sure we are taken care of, since they know we are loyal. Yun and James do an exceptional job serving us, and take care of us every time we come in.  Very good food and you dont have to drive to K town to get it.",

                  "review": "So I had two bad experiences here. First I went with a few friends and had a nice lunch. Service kinda was slow which was weird because hardly anyone was there. After we ate, we paid and left a tip. As we were leaving the guy said sir the tip. I was like what is wrong? He said it's not enough and demanded more, so we grudgingly gave more.  Next time I went it was on a date. We showed up it was a little busy so we had to wait ( this was not the problem). After we sat and ordered, our side dishes showed up. We munched on them waiting for the meat to show up. 20 to 25 mins later nothing has shown up in terms of meat. The people after us got their food before us. Then the waiter shows up and says do you want to order more. I said with an angry voice we didn't even get out first order. He quickly apologized and went to go get it. We waited another 5 mins for it.  Then after I paid and I didn't leave a tip ( who would with that kind of service).   We were in the parking lot and this guy chased me down asking about the tip. He asked if we had bad service or something.  I with a very angry tone of voice said we waited forever for our food. He quickly realized that and said sorry and went back inside.  He is a little tip for all of you that work there, if you want a tip maybe you should give good service and don't just expect a tip. A tip is a gratuity and is never mandatory.  Give better service then you get a tip.",

I almost just ordered a traditional yeast raised (can't go wrong with one of those). Instead, I opted for this crumb donut with the allure of a little crunch. It definitley didn't disappoint. The donut itself was soft and pillowy, nice and melty. The crumb sprinkle? Crunchy as a muhhhfugga. I dug it, and so did my tastebuds. I got this bad boy and a donut hole for a buck. Yep, $1. You really cannot beat that price in today's America.\n\nIf you are passing through, you need to stop by. If you live in the area, you need to be a regular.\nCrumbbbbbilicious",

My housemate and I found this one day randomly by a local gas station and now make a point to stop every single time we have to get gas.\n\nThey also have donut holes for 10 cents each & eclair puffs for .25 each. Super friendly staff. Love this place.",

They are crisp on the outside and a perfect balance of airy, moist and chewy on the inside. Perfect donuts. They do have cronuts which are also delicious. None of the nonsense of overly fancy shitty donuts here. All the classics, perfectly made.\n\nThe coffee and drinks are solid. Solid. You won't be disappointed.\n\nAnd my personal favorite are their breakfast sandwiches. I've tried quite a few in the area but none compare. The croissant is amazing--a thin layer of crunchy and crispy on the outside and an airy, buttery, chewiness on the inside. Not dense and not dry--just delicious. This may not seem like a big deal but I feel like this is where most crossaints fail. The contents of the sandwich are also very well prepared. The eggs are fluffy and moist, the ham or bacon cooked to perfection, and gooey cheese with the perfect pull.\n\nIt's just really freaking good.\n\nPrice? A steal. This morning we got a chai ice tea, two sandwiches, and two donuts, because we just couldn't resist. $12. Couldn't believe it. They even threw in a free glazed donut. I didn't know such a deal existed in LA.\n\nThere's a reason people love this place with such fervor on Yelp. What a treasure.",

This place seriously broke my diet!\n\nI personally prefer glazed, crumb or maple donuts!",

Their croissants are the bready style but still had lots of flavor, the cinnamon roll was sturdy and tasty, the bismark filling had a nice\ncustardy style filling not like most places.  The cronut was flaky and good, the real star is the buttermilk really delicious, I asked to try a donut hole and the lady at the counter stuffs a bunch in the box, Super nice gesture.  Thanks.",

The guy running the store sure seemed to take true pride in his doughnuts and it made me proud to be an American supporting a local business.\n\nDonuts USA has all the most common donuts you'd expect like raised, caked, glazed, iced, sugar, long, round, and the donut du jour ... The cronut (labeled croissant donuts in the shop probably to prevent copyright crap). Prices on the cronuts (aka croughnut) seem pretty reasonable compared to other donut shops on the West side of Los Angeles.\n\nThe store is small with parking in the strip mall good for about 8 cars. Donuts USA is not a fancy (or really even clean) donut store. It does sell delicious donuts and cronuts which is all I was looking for to be honest. I wanted to binge on some cheap 'n sweet calories and what better way to improve a stressful day than with a Glazed Cronut, Strawberry and Cream Cronut, and a classic Glazed Old-fashioned Doughnut?\n\nDid the donuts work their decadent magic? Well, they actually did. I felt better (and full). I jumped in my car and the Miley song was on ... and the Miley song was on ... and the Miley song was on.\n\n  Got my hands up, they're playin' my song\n     And now I'm gonna be okay\n  Yeah! It's Donuts in the USA!\n     Yeah! It's Donuts in the USA!\nSee all photos from Michael S. for Donuts USA",

The donut holes aren't too overly sweet which I really like, and they don't leave a weird film in your mouth like some places.  The mini chocolate croissants are delicious too!

I chose the former two plus a maple and chocolate long john. Nothing spectacular. The cronut itself was moist, but the dryness of the sugar-cinnamon combination could have been offset by a more fluid sweeter, like a creme or light custard. I've had better at Paris Baguette.\n\nParking was easy when I came, but I can see it being a problem during morning rush hour. There are about 4-6 spots for several businesses in this strip mall.\n\nThe lady was friendly, but English isn't her first language so communication can be challenging. From what I understood, the shop \"orders\" the cronuts by 6pm for delivery the next day. She suggested coming in the morning (they open at 4am) when the variety is at its greatest.\n\nNote for the handicapped: the sidewalk is under construction, so access will be difficult (I was in a wheelchair for 3 months so I understand your pain.)",

The little cake donuts here are SOO incredibly soft and fluffy. The texture is absolute perfection. A couple of my coworkers got the last cinnamon rolls on display (they're huge by the way!) and they could not say enough good things about them. Definitely need to give those a try the next time I'm back!\n\nIn addition to their donuts and cronuts and other yummy treats they also serve sandwiches, made to order! I got the roast beef sandwich in a croissant and it was delicious. The croissant is huge and they fill it up with a generous helping of roast beef, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, etc.\n\nThe store itself is quite small, with a few tables for those who want to dine in. Most people seem to just come in and out for takeout orders though. The parking lot is unfortunately tiny and I could imagine it being frustrating to find a place to park your car during peak hours.\n\nThey've recently gone through a change in ownership and I got to see both the new and old owners during my visit (the old owners were training/helping out the new owners which I thought was adorable). Both new and old owners are such sweet and smiley people! And they make FANTASTIC donuts!\n\nOverall, totally one of my new favorite places to get donuts. YUM YUM~",

It's a donut shop in the afternoon, what could possibly be left.\n\nAnd there they were: cronuts. Now I hate every food trend that comes along, and the idea of cronuts bothered me more than the hipsters raving about them. But up close, what else could I say? I had to have one... or two...\n\nI took a simple glaze, but really wanted a strawberry cream. $3, and totally worth it. When I asked about  the donut holes, she said ten cents. So I figured why not try one. She gave it to me for free! Awesome!\n\nGreat people, and great donut shop, with a wide variety to choose. Fresh tasting, even mid day. Can't ask for more.",

I don't go out of my way to get the sweet circular treats, nor do I crave 'em often. So it's rare I eat donuts in the first place, let alone write a review about 'em.\n\nAfter reading reviews and seeing the almost 5-star rating of Donuts USA I felt it was in my best interest to check the place out. The little mom'n'pop shop is small but quaint. The store features three separate booths to sit down at, though you'll most likely grab-n-go, so it's not a big deal.\n\nDonuts USA, when compared to other places, doesn't have the biggest selection of donuts--but then again I haven't been on a weekend yet, which is probably when they bring out the big guns. That's not to say you'll be dissatisfied; on the contrary the old-fashioned blueberry glazed donut I had for a mere 80 cents was one of the best donuts I've ever had. It was fresh, and had the most perfect texture. You know, the one where it's slightly crispy on the outside, but has that buttery cake-like dough inside. I'm almost fearful now that I live so close, I can practically have these delectable morsels whenever I choose.\n\nFor 80 cents a donut this place rocks. Much better than going to some of those other places.",

For some reason, thousands of them settled in Southern California and opened doughnut shops. After witnessing unimaginable acts of genocide by their government, I suppose frying up sweet, tasty bundles of joy that make people happy was a way to forget.\n\nEnough with the history lesson. I'm not even sure this place is owned by Cambodians - there was a friendly Hispanic lady running the show when I stopped in tonight. I ordered a raised, glazed doughnut and a glazed buttermilk bar. These are the doughnuts by which I judge all shops. I am happy to report that Donuts USA passed the test. The raised glazed was light and airy, a tiny bit chewy and melted in my mouth. But not in a sugary, cotton candy way like the ones at Krispy Kreme. This one had some substance. The buttermilk bar was at the same time, both dense and light. I don't know how they do it but the good shops have figured it out.\n\nNext time I will test their ham and cheese croissant, another staple of the independent doughnut shop. I have no doubt that Donuts USA will pass that test, either.",

Not only are their donuts incredible, but the bacon egg and cheese croissant is unlike anything I've ever had in the last couple of years. Every friend I've had try it loved it as much as I did. At this point every time I come in, the sweet owners just say \"breakfast?\" and make me that order. This is the only place I go to where I can say 'the usual'. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended. Go in there, try that bacon egg and cheese croissant and I dare you to not fall in love.",

Well, and the food.\n\nI was in the mood for a donut, passed the place, and walked in. Was greeted quickly and warmly by the two proprietors. Got a chocolate donut and a bacon and cheese croissant sandwich. Only after they gave me my order did I see the CASH ONLY sign. Oops! I only had $2.75 on me and my order was $3.75. I apologized and asked where the nearest bank was.\n\nThey told me not to be ridiculous, $2.75 was fine, and not to worry about it at all. They had a repeat customer from that moment. After going about 3 times they were already making my croissant sandwich before I even ordered it. This place is the real deal when it comes to customer service. They are so sweet!\n\nOh, the donuts are great, but the chocolate isn't the best. Glazed... brownies... couple other things are awesome.",

It should be noted that I am a person mindful of what I eat and my calories, but when I splurge I make it a point to go here and have a glazed twist donut. It's a MUST TRY and I promise You Will NOT be disappointed!  This man has been in business for 24 years and I can see why! Two thumbs way up for Donuts USA on Venice Blvd.",

The asian woman behind the counter can be a little gruff in the mornings on first impression because she barks, but she's really a sweetheart. My advice, skip the coffee and buy extra of the sugar covered donuts. The coffee's not great, but the donuts are to die for and really cheap. Slightly crispy on the outside, melt in your mouth good. The french crullers are great too. Fluffy and eggy, kind of dense like custard. Good stuff!",

May be too busy for them to always  greet with a big smile but wouldn't it be tough if you were serving people since 5 AM? They are  down my street and live locally as well so there is a very neighborly feel for me.  My favorites are cake donut with orange icing (it even has a little orange peel in it), the chocolate old fashioned and the apple fritters. Their breakfast sandwiches are very good and not greasy.  I like their traditional cappuccino, but their coffee is weaker than what Im used to (ie -  by Starbucks standards).. Their parking lot is a mess because it is so small, but I tell you the doughnuts are worth it.",

Since the restaurant was closing after we ate our dinner, we wanted to go somewhere else for dessert. I love that this place is open late and has so many dessert options. The man who took our order was very nice and explained the menu. We got a slice of chocolate lava cake and a slice of belgian chocolate cheesecake. They were good, not great, but good. The cheesecake tasted like it recently came out of the freezer. We also ordered lattes, which were fine. If you have a late night sweet tooth and you are in the area, then this is a good option.\nChocolate lava cake\nBelgian chocolate cheesecake\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n3/28/2022\nBina,",

I would have preferred they be a little chilled instead of really cold. It's a rich dessert but really a good treat.

When we first arrived, the inside of the place was really stuffy and there was a visible layer of smoke near the ceiling. When we got to the front of the line, the worker was friendly and even gave us a discount for our first visit (10% discount for first-timers). However, when we received our Nutella crepe ($10: $5 for the crepe and $5 for the Nutella topping), the crepe was rubbery and did not taste right. Additionally, the crepe was flooded with the soft Nutella topping that seemed slightly diluted. Unfortunately, I do not think I will be back for a while unless I become desperate and this is the only place open again.

The smell of chocolate in the air along with a visual of a clean shop with plenty of space to sit at. The menu was full of chocolate options (overwhelming, but in a good way), but I could see that there was something for everyone. I went with something simple for my first time and got a Nutella fruit cup. The employee working there was very kind and patient with me. He was accommodating with my requests!\n\nOverall the fruit was fresh and Nutella delicious (per usual). I'll definitely be coming back to try their other products.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nTaylor C.\nBusiness Customer Service",

And, yanno... sometimes you just crave chocolate. And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nI've gotten a few items from this place so far. Cream puffs, which were a little weirdly melty since hot chocolate had been poured over them, and their pancake bites, which are lovely, fluffy little nibbles that serve more as a vehicle for chocolate than anything. No objections there.\n\nMy partner has gotten their lava cake a couple of times and really enjoyed that as well. It comes with a healthy scoop of vanilla ice cream, just in case you're looking for something a la mode.\n\nI'll definitely be ordering from them again soon. They have a fruit and chocolate fondue plate you can order, and you bet I'll be scoping that out next.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nTaylor C.\nBusiness Customer Service",

(Dessert) He was craving a banana split and that was right on the menu, I looked around and I was enthused about all the varieties. However I kept it simple and that was probably my mistake. I ordered a brownie sundae, we get everything to go. My friend claims his banana split was fire (in other words it was delicious) for me the ice cream in itself was just ok, it didn't have that creamy factor like when you go to another ice cream shop such as Cold Stones or Ben n Jerry's.\n\nThe brownie was disgusting, artificial brownies to me are by far the worst kind. The texture and the taste are both off putting, they cut the brownie into cube slices, so I was eating a cube at a time with some ice cream and i couldn't take it, I just ate the ice cream and threw everything else away.\nI'll be returning another time but I for sure will stay clear from any of the brownies.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool 1\nTaylor C.\nBusiness Customer Service",

I love the waffles and crepes as well as selection of european chocolates that you cannot really find around LA. The quality of their food extremely great, cannot think of anywhere else to order desert from. So this review has nothing to do with the food itself. I have never walked in and bought the food from the store but has ordered every single time through Postmates. In the last 2 weeks I have ordered and tried getting my food through Postmates but I can never get it delivered. I usually order late at night and I always did but for some reason it just doesn't work out. I placed an order around 12 AM, it got accepted, it was being \"prepared\" and then at 1:26 I get a call from Postmates driver saying that the place is closed. This is now the second time in a row and honestly its extremely frustrating. I waited 1.5 hours for a waffle to prepared and dispatched. I live in Westwood, maybe 2 miles away from the store. I order food from Postmates on a daily basis and this place is the only one that I seem to have problem with. I just want to understand why this keeps happening.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n3/28/2022\nZiya,",

Parking is metered and there are many other restaurants in the area. Right on the other side of the street is the Westfield mall.\n\nThe shop has nice details to it. On the entry they have chocolate like drippings high on the wall. When you enter you are welcomed by the lovely smell of pancakes & chocolates. They have their menu displayed on the entrance and also on the screen when you enter. They do ask for your cell no. to notify you when your order is ready which is good during these times. They have displayed some of their menu items, not sure if its dummy or real!hehe! which I find interesting.\n\nWhen we arrived there were no customers. There was a guy who greeted us. We ordered their \"Sampler plate- $22.99\". Which consists of crepes, waffles & mini pancakes as he mentioned. You can simultaneously look at your order as they charge you. I said I wanted extra Nutella sauce & he said thats fine, plus strawberries ($1.99). All fine until now. And now the reason for the missing stars. He started having some problem with the machine & was not able to charge us correctly, He then said you gotta choose one more topping, I asked him how many toppings are included & he had no idea & suggested that we go for cookie butter, which we did not want, but we had customers after us waiting so just decided to get done with it, & asked him to put that on a side separately. He charged us $3.99 for \"extra topping\", when we asked him what the extra charge was for, he said for extra Nutella, so you are making changes in our order even without us knowing.  \n\nI already asked for Nutella & strawberries only, then why would you ask me to add other topping & charge me extra for that, which I did not even want. We payed & waited outside for our order. When we received the order we checked it (cant blame us after that happened). Their was no extra topping that he charged us for. When we went inside to ask him, he'd gone on his break & a girl came. And damn the attitude she had, she was furious & gave me a small cup half filled with Nutella sauce like she is doing me a favor.\n\nThe product- the crepes & mini pancakes were over cooked, & hard to chew, the waffles were cooked nicely. It would have been nice if the guy knew fully about the menu.I am never coming back to this place.\nSee all photos from Tejal B. for Chocolate Bash\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nTaylor C.\nBusiness Customer Service",

My family and I have been coming here for the past years here and there for dessert. Last time we ordered to help support them being a local business and all we did not like how our order was packed, coming to us all messy. Very disappointing.\nThen last night we were craving milk shakes and remembered we really always liked their shakes but this time we drove the ten minutes so that we wouldn't be disappointed again. We ordered two milk shakes and a waffle plate to go. Watching from outside we saw the young girl who took our order complete making our items but then but them  aside on a counter. Instead of waving us down to let us know they were ready. Knowing we were waiting.\nThen I walked in for it a second later and another kid asked if I was a Postmates driver instead of asking or being more aware I was already in there and waiting. I thought that was annoying and rude. They seem to young children running their operations which doesn't seem like a very smart thing to do. Especially when the kids customer service and awarness isn't satisfactory. And I say it all the time, I'm a customer service first type of guy and if the customer service isn't working, I definitely won't be returning.\nMy order was terrible on top of that. The two milk shakes we're very watered-down tasting. Not thick or ice cream tasting at all. The waffle was okay but we weren't fans of the chocolate and the fact that all our toppings were not already mixed in together. There are businesses that have shut down due to this pandemic we are all going through, yet this place is still around when their are better businesses closed? I don't get it. But my family and I will definitely not be returning and I do not recommend them at all.\nUseful 2\nFunny 1\nCool\nTaylor C.\nBusiness Customer Service",

My first order I asked for two strawberry milkshakes and two create your own, as well for chocolate strawberries. Which rounded up to 65$ then to realize they only charged me for one strawberry milkshake He said he made the mistake and then the girl charged me for another I wasn't upset yet because I said anyone could make that mistake. So when I was being charged I seen some cookie that where foreign as well for chocolate and other goodies. So I added two cookie and a chocolate. Then the girl told me she didn't have enough change for me that I had to  buy more.? So I said okay and added cookies that where at a higher price. There still not enough change? She said she could give me dollars in nickels or that I needed to buy more? So I told her add a chocolate strawberry she ended up adding two so I would get any change back so after the the 60$ I spent on the first order with a 5$ tip in the jar. I still paid 25$ on the second order. Then to find out when I got to the car my mini pancakes I asked for ice scream he had even gave me the options of the ice scream and I said Twix only in the crepes he didn't not charge me for the ice scream and put Twix on the wrong order. I was annoyed and not about to go back in the store and argued I'm pregnant and I was craving mini pancakes with ice scream I ended having to go somewhere else just to get my craving.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nTaylor C.\nBusiness Customer Service",

It is my destiny.\nOn top of that, not only is the music always great, but every single person who works here is an absolute delight. They're all friendly, gregarious, and quite generous with samples--a definite plus.\nShout out to Kilani!! The best! MVP! A connoisseur of chocolate. A master or the sugary arts. And a joy to talk to.\n\nEdit: as I was writing this review kilani approached me and my boyfriend with faux-gravitas, saying that whoever wrote the best review would get free candy.

I ordered from Ubereats, and called the store-- Anes picked up-- and I explained to him what I was hoping to do-- and although he could have been bothered or just half heartedly helped, he went out of his way. He even let me text him exactly what I wanted to say-- and not only did he not complain at all-- he made it SO pretty!!!

Next time I would just use the butter as a dipping sauce for the fruits. They have outdoor heaters too, but the employees that night didn't know how to get them on.",

Some of the flavor that I would recommend would definitely be the Belgium chocolate and the chocolate butter. Their crepes textures are pretty chewy too! I was a satisfied customer!\n\nFinally, for your information. This place may not be for everyone as they can get a little to sweet. Nonetheless it is worth the try if you never mind high level of sweetness!\nBelgium chocolate and chocolate butter crepes!\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n8/2/2018\nHendra, it's always a nice surprise when your expectations are exceeded, and I'm thrilled we were able to do that!

Total was about $91.00, upon checking my order one is missing chocolate keep in mind I had answered the chocolate question 3x sent my sister in and the guy had the nerve to tell her it would be xtra $5 after I had confirmed 3x yes to chocolate !!!  In addition I order a Nutella milkshake and guess what !!! It was half full with ice !!!! Really guys you charge $9+ for milkshake and fill it up with ice cubes ???? Never coming here again.\nWhat was supposed to be a Nutella milkshake.

Lastly, my son has peanut allergies and Sky made sure to clean and sterilize all utensils and brought out a separate \"board\" to make his delicious chocolate burrito on. Again, incredible customer service to go along with incredible desserts. Thank You!!\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n11/13/2019Previous review\nIncredible. Amazing. Delish. Yummy. Awesome.\n\nIt was 10p on a Friday and we were chilling at home al cozy having a \"Netflix & chill\" evening. Uh oh, chocolate cravings hit us both. Thanks to some gummy edibles there was no way either of us could drive. Yelp to the rescue.\n\nFound Chocolate Bash and figured, \"hey, why not, let's give em a try.\" We had enough sense not to overdue it and just ordered one dessert each. To say it was great would be an understatement (and no it wasn't great because of the edible).  \n\nThe flavors burst in your mouth and the portions were generous. They delivered early (which rocks when you're craving chocolate) and their prices are fair. Definitely suggest ordering from here whenever you're in the mood for some great desserts.",

When I walked in, I greeted the woman at the counter with a smile on my face, but she ignored me. We stood in front of the counter for about five minutes waiting to be acknowledged, but not one of the two employees said a word to us. A group of guys walked in after us, and the woman started chatting with them, continuing to ignore us. I continued to look at the menu, and noticed that to add Nutella to the build your own crepe cost $3.99. I can buy a whole jar of Nutella for that much. Maybe $1 or $2, but $4?? That's a bit ridiculous. We left without ever being acknowledged. Don't plan on returning.\n\nEDIT: I have gone through and noticed A LOT of negative reviews specifically mentioning the amount of time it takes to get their orders, and also the horrible customer service. The business owner replies saying things will change, but clearly on my visit, there hasn't been any change. Maybe it's time to hire new employees that are quick and friendly?\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool 1\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n11/6/2018\nSarah, I'm very sorry if you felt like you received anything other than friendly customer service from the moment you walked into our place.

We ordered a banana split - they literally gave us a sliced banana and ice cream. NOTHING ELSE ON IT. Then I asked for the lava cake and asked if it came with ice cream. She said yes. We opened our boxes at the hotel and mine had no ice cream. Then...my husband went to eat his \"banana split\" which had ice cream and they only gave us a knife and a fork. No spoon. I will not recommend this. I would like a refund but we paid in cash and we tipped them!  We tried to call and the number kept ringing that the party was unavailable.

Well...wait 20 minutes at Chocolate Bash.\n\nI was so excited when I came across this chocolate shop after work and needed a sugary pick me up. The interior is very clean and cute. The walls have rectangular coffers which give the inside a very \"fancy\" appearance. One wall even has an architectural element that looks as if chocolate is oozing from the ceiling and it's super cute! What's even more adorable is the tiny tiny baby Nutella they have for sale! But back to the review, I waited for quite some time to receive 3 strawberries dipped in chocolate. The presentation was pretty as it had three different colored chocolates but the strawberries were of all sizes (small, medium, large) and still slightly warm from the chocolate. It would have been nice to at least get a heads up of the 20 minute wait time.\n\nOverall, won't be visiting again but the price of a little over $5 isn't too bad for 3 strawberries.\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n6/27/2018\nDanielle, we thank you for stopping by for a sweet treat.

Regardless, they make all of their pastries they are serving fresh (waffles, pancakes, crepes, etc.) As you are waiting for your food to be prepared you can see them making it. The fruit is not always the sweetest but whatever you get on top whether that be chocolate, lotus spread, or Nutella, it overpowers so its all good.\n\nSometimes the staff is disengaged and they may be on the phone as they are waiting for your food to be prepared, the place is an overall nice establishment for a late night treat!\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n7/16/2018\nI'm so pleased to see you think we're the secret gem of LA!

When we finally got our order the ice cream was all melted. When we finally got into the crepes they were stiff and hard to cut. It was simply not worth the money. I've gotten better crepes for 7$ with an overflow of fruit and filling. These crepes tasted like pure Nutella, to the point where it was unbearable. They charge you for EVERY ADD ON. Nutella? 3.99$. Strawberry? 1.50$. Pistachios? 5.99$. Did I mention that they're not filled with anything? Just a folded thin pancake with a pound of Nutella drizzled on and 2 chopped strawberries. Waited 30 minutes for that. Try Viva la Vida crepes on Broadway and  Vernon for some real crepes!!! And then have some delicious tacos across the Ross Parking lot.

My friends and I were craving desert after our dinner so we went here as an alternative.\n\nWe shared a $9 fruit platter between the four of us. It was so cute with a mini tea candle in the middle to melt the chocolate. I'd say portion size was really good for all of us!! Highly recommend.\n\nOther parties were walking by with interesting platters of chocolates and drizzled bars and such..I felt like we were at a cheaper version of a fancy chocolate store. I wish I spent more time deciding what I wanted but the menu was confusing...\n\nLattes...EXTREMELY sweet. If you want to be bouncing off the walls, get their drinks because they are loaded with sugar.\n\nOverall, the brand of the place is a little cheesy, but the treats are fun and unlike a lot of typical dessert/ice cream/waffle stores. I'd come here again if I was ever in the area.\nSENXUALLY!\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n4/19/2018\nJanelle, thanks for stopping by to satisfy your sweet tooth!

Like whipped cream or powdered sugar or something.\n\nOrdered a waffle with nutella and kinder pieces.  Came out to a bit over $12.  Not really sure if they changed the sizes, but 1 waffle was not a lot of food for 2 people like one of the previous reviews said.  The nutella was drizzled on, it was a good amount but not cut with anything, *cough* whipped cream *cough*, so it got boring fast.  The kinder pieces were broken up over the waffle so that wasn't anything special.  So lazy, they didn't even try to incorporate it into the waffle batter.  This was something I could literally make at home.  There was no imagination in any of it.\n\nAlso, service needs to be improved.  She, clearly, saw that we were sitting by the door but she put the finished food on the counter on the other side of the room and then went to the registers, that were in the middle of the room, and alerted the buzzers that our food was ready.  My table and the table next to us went to the registers to get the food and she pointed at the other side of the room.  Um...thanks.\nUseful 2\nFunny 1\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n10/12/2017\nI appreciate you taking the time to leave your feedback, Jenny.

There weren't any grand opening signs or balloons, so I was surprised to see that it was open for business.  I stopped in late one evening and ordered a lotus crepe, which was made with crumbled Biscoff cookies and spread.  The total came out to just under $11.  The crepe was very rich and sweet but still enjoyable.  I do think the price point is a few dollars higher than it should be.  Chocolate Bash is kind of like a build-your-own dessert place.  You pick a base of either a crepe, waffle, pancake or mini pancake for $4.99, then choose between lotus Biscoff cookies, Nutella and Belgium chocolate spread for an extra charge of $2.99.  It's an additional charge if you want to add crumbled cookies, ice cream, etc.  Very good, but I would come back more regularly if they lowered the prices a tad.\n\nThere is street parking, a small lot across the street with meters, or you can park in the Westside Pavilion for free.\nLotus crepe $10.39 (incl. tax)",

Firstly, there were Christmas decorations in July, also it's rona season so there is nothing to be jolly about. Next, the menu was extremely confusing, what is the sushi crepe? What is a karak, why is it iced? Why is there a crepe burrito? What is happening with the creme puffs? There was literally no rhyme or reason to anything happening. My boyfriend settled on the crepe (I wanted the pancakes but I let him win this senseless war) I watched the lady behind the counter make a crepe with a hole in it then a guy take over and turn the crepe into an origami fortune teller for all I could see and then literally smother it with cookie butter and Nutella. It was a sea of chocolate, I felt like the 9 dollars I paid I would have been happier buying a jar of cookie butter and Nutella.\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\nTaylor C.\nBusiness Customer Service",

They have dark, milk, and white chocolate options and they are all made fresh to order.They also have these creme puffs that they cover with nutella and white chocolate which literally taste like heaven. I love stopping by this place or ordering them through delivery apps like Postmates or DoorDash!! Delivery chocolate people!!! :) They are open until 2am so they are a solid choice for late night chocolate cravings. They also have a selection of overseas candies to purchase as well. I love this place. The staff is friendly too and they have a frequent buyer punch card! Enjoy!\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool\nTaylor C.\nBusiness Customer Service",

Mini pancakes were good, nice amount of chocolate and we choose cookies on top so was a good combination. What really ruin our experience was the bash roll. It was TOTALLY RAW. Besides, we wait for 30 minutes for our order when it was just two tables occupied, and the attitude of the employees didn't help, slow and not a single smile, they didn't tell when the order was finally ready.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool 1\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n9/24/2018\nAlaa, I'm very sorry if the wait for your mini pancakes and bash roll took a little longer than usual. It's likely that we wanted it to be perfect and fresh for you. It's great that the mini pancakes hit the spot, but I apologize if the bash roll wasn't what you were expecting. I'll be sure to reiterate our high customer service standards with the staff so that you don't run into this problem in the future. I hope you'll visit us again soon. We're looking forward to giving you the five-star experience you deserve.\n",

The latte was decent.  But the Nutella mocha frap was very disappointing.  It was very watery and nothing Nutella or frap about it. It had no flavor and was basically just a cold coffee.  \nThe crepe was pretty good. The only bad thing was that the crepe was a little too thick and it was very hard to cut.  We ordered fruit, Nutella and an ice cream scoop with it.  The presentation of the crepe was really nice and the fruit, ice cream, and Nutella servings were just right.  The only thing was that the crepe was a little too thick.\nThe service was okay.  The lady at the register seemed polite but not particularly friendly.\nHot latte and Nutella fruit crepe",

This place uses dairy in everything, that's fine it's America. We were not deterred and still interested in trying a dish beacuse the setting was pretty rad and the nice lady at the register was kind and very helpful. Of course we weren't interested in the lovely effects a lot of dairy could produce for us, so we humbly asked for her for the \"smallest dish available.\" Because of the dairy ya know, simple. A not so-lovely gentleman standing beside her (who never greeted nor acknowledged us) overheard our question and scoffed at the request as he sarcastically repeated our question and walked away to gobble down his Dasani.\n\nI'm not disappointed in the business nor the food. I actually cannot speak to the food. I do not know who this man was as we exited because our food requests could not be met, not a big deal. But this employee (who seemed like manager) took no interest in listening to our concerns or serving us in any manner, despite being in the service industry. So we took no interest in patroning his establishment.\n\nI hope you have a better experience that we did. Eat on!\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n7/3/2018\nLukas, I'm terribly sorry you had this experience. We can assure you that this is not a regular occurrence, as there certainly is a more appropriate way to respond to customer requests. It's likely the manager was concerned about the lactose allergy, as there is not an item that is dairy-free -- still, taking it out this way is inappropriate. It's disappointing that you weren't able to give us a try, especially since you're a fan of our setting and atmosphere. We hope you'll give us another shot to try something small and tasty.\n",

And waiting. There were three employees working. 2 lady's and one guy. The guy looked at me and softly said just a minute. Then went to a tablet, looked at the order after swiping on it, and started making a crepe for someone, mind you he didn't wash his hands. Gross. The two ladies had their back to me as they were gossiping and talking about the events of their day OUTSIDE of work, which is understandable. However, one looked at me as she went to the freezer to pull items for an order and didn't acknowledge I was standing there looking bewildered. So I waited more, til finally she came up and asked what she could get me. I told her the company and order number, and then she goes to the tablet and says it will be 10-15 minutes, since they hadn't looked at the tablet for the order. So, she went about starting to make another order, after touching the tablet, and the pc, without washing her hands as well. Also wasn't wearing her mask properly, just had the mouth covered but not the nose. She had glasses, so maybe it was fogging them up? Waited for another 15 minutes and finally had the order so I could be on my way. They were nice enough, but the service could have been much faster with three people working, and, the could have maybe focused more on the orders rather than the gossip.",

I ordered a mini fruit kabob. Something so simple that shouldn't take that long to make. I understand you have to cook the pancakes but I also ordered a scoop of ice cream for my daughter and they could have easily served her the scoop while we waited for the kabob but no they made us wait for that too. I came in here with high expectations and desire for desert after having a great dinner across the street. So disappointed, this trip ruined my night. I've never complained about any place or service but this was just too much. And they weren't understaffed or busy that's why I feel I have the right to complain. No excuses, totally unacceptable.\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n10/20/2017\nI want to personally apologize for your wait time, Leticia. It's possible there was a miscommunication with your order or our team member was new, though those are no excuse for you to be kept waiting.

I've only been here once so I haven't met the other employees.  I went here on my birthday, they played a hilariously funny birthday song in the restaurant for me, which my friends and I appreciated. The counter guys checked up on us often, asking if we needed anything, and cleaning up as we are.\n\nFood: I liked that the chocolate is REAL chocolate and not that gross \"chocolate flavored\" sauce stuff. Smooth, not grainy, powdery or burnt/overcooked.\n\nProportions: generous amount of chocolate. So it made the fruit and treats particularly good. Fruit was fresh, the baked items were fresh tasting.\n\nPrice: expensive, but they use real chocolate and pour it generously. The fruit portions weren't that big, but ok for the occasional outing.\n\nFor an ok priced treat every once in a while, I like the chocolate banana. But it's still a little more expensive than you might expect so I wouldn't come here that often except for maybe special occasion.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n4/24/2019\nHappy belated birthday, Alex.

We eventually asked when it hit 30 minutes and they said they would be working on it. 30 minutes later, my boyfriend had to talk to them again because they hadn't realized that we were still waiting. I understand that it was busy due to Postmates/DoorDash orders, but they should not forget about the customers sitting inside. By this time, I was furious. It shouldn't take an hour to wait for a dessert. Not only did it take long, it wasn't even fully cooked because they were rushing it. Definitely not returning to this place again.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nRasha A.\nBusiness Owner\n3/12/2019\nShonna, I'm very sorry if the wait was a little longer than usual. We do get fairly busy, so we try our best to be as quick as possible. Perfection takes time, so it's a bummer that we couldn't impress you more with our crepes. I truly hope you'll give us another chance to show you the quality treats we're known for.\n",

It's likely that the driver didn't double check before leaving or had other deliveries to make before getting to you which is why it took so long. It's disappointing when you don't get the treats you wanted, so for that I apologize. I hope the fruit was enjoyable and that you'll visit us in person soon.\n",
