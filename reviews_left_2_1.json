Possibly my wife's favorite kaiseki-style restaurant.\n\nSince there are no choices to be made aside from beverages, I won't proffer a detailed breakdown of the meal. You can just be prepared to have a great meal. No faults in the sake menu, nor in the service. The ambience of the place is nice: a small, converted house feel.\n\nOther notes:\n-I think they offer valet parking, but I was able to luck into parking in one of the side streets a couple of blocks away (for the later seating).\n-They seem to care about dietary restrictions. A member of our group doesn't eat meat, and they were able to replace the beef portions of the meal with fish / vegetarian options (and the replacements sometimes seemed better than the original!).",

I admit to not having a very sophisticated palate but I think nnaka provides a decent range of variation for people across the board. Dishes consisted of nothing too exotic (I've had meals where I couldn't bring myself to put items into my mouth....imagine Fear Factor), but the preparation of ingredients made things interesting. The raw dishes were standard but all very fresh which I find is the top priority in sushi. Some of the sauces used really exemplified the umami of the fish.\nThe courses were presented in a meditated order that prevented the raw fish fatigue I often get with just sushi omakase. The soups and palate cleansers were served at the exact opportune moments when I would normally begin to tire of the long train of dishes.\nService was impeccable, the server even asked if I'd prefer a white or black table napkin.\nThe only thing I might have found a bit underwhelming was the peach mousse cake (2nd dessert-main dessert). The edible plating elements of that particular dessert actually tasted more refined than the cake itself. By no means was it a bad cake, it just didn't stand out. I actually liked the pre-dessert more. All in all it was a fabulous meal and I would love to return when the menu changes.\nSee all photos from Grace C. for n/naka",

We got a welcome drink and napkins shortly followed by our first of 13 courses. The service was so friendly, it didn't feel obnoxiously fancy at all. It was laid back but also so put together. I love the seasonality of Kaiseki and the idea of making the ingredients the star of the show and showing them in their purest forms. Everything melted in your mouth and was perfectly paired! Not to mention Niki herself came out at before we left which was so special. I love that she does that! I'd definitely come back one day. If you're coming to LA and want a special experience I highly suggest coming here!  \nAlso great for birthdays! They also gave me a special birthday dessert and took a Polaroid for me!\nSee all photos from Madison B. for n/naka",

                  "review": "3 photos\nLike a lot of people, I first heard of Chef Niki Nakayama from watching Chef's Table on Netflix! It is definitely my favorite episode of the entire series. I was so intrigued by her not just as a Chef, but her work ethics, her drive and passion for what she loves. I especially admire her drive to prove others wrong: \"Kuyashii\" (when someone puts you down or tells you you can't do something, then you have this burning desire to prove them wrong)! After watching her episode, I hoped to one day dine at her restaurant... well, that one day came sooner than I expected. I literally lost my breath for a second when the bf surprised me for my birthday.\n\nUpon walking in, the restaurant is exactly like how the show described it: Minimalistic interior because everything is focused on the food. It was so surreal to see the restaurant and the same people from the show. Without a doubt, we had our kaiseki with wine pairings. You have the option to choose either sake or wine pairings, but the wine pairings do have some sake options so that's what we went for. Fair warning, it's a LOT of wine...so if you're not a big drinker, maybe consider sharing a pairing. They were so generous with the wine pairings that I couldn't finish my wines; they were lined up on our table and eventually had to be taken away because there was no more room. haha~ Having said that, hands down, this is the best wine/sake pairings we've ever had. It was amazing how each wine/sake complimented so well with each of our courses.\n\nEach course was so elegantly plated, it was almost too good to eat. As the Chef described in the show, you can tell she put her heart and soul into each of the courses she makes. I don't know how but every bite of every course was so flavorful and unique, even down to the tiny vegetables from her own garden. I know there was supposed to be 13 courses, but I felt like there was a lot more. Towards the end, I thought it was funny when our server asked me \"Are you ok? We're almost done...\" I.was.so.full. :D\n\nTo completely make our night even more amazing, Chef Niki personally came out and wished me a happy birthday and we got to thank her for an amazing evening and take photos with her. I really wanted to hug her, but I tried to contain myself. :) Needless to say, this was such an amazing night and I'm a very lucky girl. ;)",

I couldn't believe my luck when I got the notification at 3am that a 5:30pm reservation on a Saturday opened up two days later on a day my husband was available to join me. What! Stupid lucky.\n\nHaving been to Japan and experienced a variety of different types of Japanese cuisine, I happen to really love kaiseki... the art of presentation, the delicate and light flavors, the thoughtfulness that goes into the preparation and choosing the right ingredients, etc. At n/naka you really feel that with each course. Chef Niki really puts her heart and soul into it. Although not every course blew me away, a majority of them did, including the sea bream, oyster starter, wagyu, and of course the mentaiko truffle abalone pasta, which was probably our favorite course of the night. Something as simple as a blue crab hand roll was truly elevated here, moreso than the other sushi served only because I have had the pleasure of eating some pretty amazing sushi already. But that blue crab roll... yum. So much better than anywhere else I've had it. At the end of the meal we did not feel stuff but satiated and more than satisfied.\n\nI really do appreciate that Chef Niki comes out and greets all of her guests after their meals. It's such a personal touch and I enjoyed the opportunity to tell her personally how much we enjoyed her food. She seems so sweet and down to earth.  \n\nI would love to come back for another visit. Time to roll that dice!",

They do call you a few days before hand to make sure if you have allergies or something you may not like. The chef tailors a new menu for your experience. Adding to the experience for future meals, the chef keeps records of your menu so she will never make the same meal twice. The experience is 13 course traditional kaiseki.\n\nThe service is above and beyond. With the serving of each course, you get an explanation of the local and imported ingredients used and how to approach eating the dish for the best experience. They also pair the dish with a wine or sake!\n\nOverall this is a place for special occasions because of the pricing per person but definitely worth it. You can not put a price on ambience, spectacular ingredients, 5 star chef and amazing food experience. Can not wait to see what Chef Niki has in store for my next experience! Note: This place is also vegetarian friendly because she does have a vegetarian kaiseki option!",

N/naka is located in a very unsuspecting part of LA, in the Culver City/Palms area.  There is valet parking for $8 when you arrive.  You'd really never know it's there unless you've been there or you've watched the Chef's Table episode on it.  I really recommend watching the n/naka chef's table episode before going. It gives you a glimpse into Chef Niki Nakayama's journey to get where she is today.  She is a tough cookie.  She is truly inspiring and you can feel her passion - it makes you appreciate the food even more.  \n\nYou will need to book a reservation through the Resy app before going and the reservations fill up quickly.  New dates are released each Sunday morning at 10:00 a.m. on the app.  You can also sign up to be notified of vacancies on certain days.  You will need to e-mail the restaurant prior to going with your information, if you've been before, allergies, etc.  Chef Niki spends time personalizing the menu and keeps track of what you've eaten at your prior visits.  \n\nWhen you arrive, the staff with greet you and offer you water or a drink before you get seated.  The place is bigger than it looks in the pictures and you don't feel cramped in the space.  It's beautifully decorated, with simple asian accents.  Be prepared, the meal took us about 3 hours - it was perfectly paced.  Each dish is brought out and explained by the waiter.  Dishes are aesthetically pleasing and perfectly presented.  The dishes kept getting better and better.  Shrimp, squid, salmon, wide variety of fish, dumpling, sashimi, pasta, wagyu beef, nagiri, hand roll, desserts...it was all amazing.  Wagyu beef was probably my favorite, along with the truffle abalone pasta.  Chef Niki will come out and greet you once you're done with your meal.  She doesn't make you feel rushed and is happy to chat and take a picture with you.  Expect to pay about $250 - $300 per person on average (we had a drink and an extra blue crab hand roll).  \n\nTruly amazing experience.  I will definitely be going back.\nSee all photos from Lisa G. for n/naka",

It takes patience to finally get a reservation. All the anticipation puts expectations at a high so then I get a little worried it won't be as good ...\n\nIt was such a worthy culinary experience!\n\nFrom the minute we walked up to the door - Hanna came out to greet us and even helped us take a picture. The staff was so attentive and helpful and really knew how to help you experience the full 3hours. They know their Kaiseki.\n\nThe care in prep is amazing. All allergies and preferences you let them know before hand are planned out and before the deserts we were offered a crab hand roll to top off dinner and it is a favorite, so here it was a divine ending. Thank you n/naka - how did you know???\n\nMaybe it was because we were there but their green tea was really well... perfect!\n\nIt is 13 courses (faves: A5 wyagu beef, corn mushroom broth,  abalone pasta, spoonful of lobster, but all were delicious - and oh perch sashimi...) with a special cap and for my birthday surprise a bite of a green tea cake and sliver of chocolate and a candle to wish on.\n\nIt is $185 per person not including tax + tip + plus anything from the bar. Basically front row seats at your favorite concert. Thank you Chef Niki and Carol and staff for making this a concert to remember.\nSee all photos from Creativist J. for n/naka",

It was AMAZING. The wagyu beef, sushi, sashimi, and lobster tempura were my favorite parts of the meal. My husband was still a bit hungry afterwards but I was ok.\n\nWe then ate the sushi bento on night #2. There were some similar dishes from the night prior (rice, matcha cake..) It was good but I believe the Kaiseki J\u016bbako is far superior compared to the sushi bento box.\n\nIt was easy picking up the bento box, it literally took 2 minutes because of their efficient system.\nIf you have never eaten at n/naka before, give their bento boxes a try!\nI can't wait for their doors to open so we can dine-in.",

For the record, it took myself and le hubs 4 months before we *almost* gave up on the online reservation system and opted to personally email the establishment with our request.  We got so lucky as they were able to oblige and off we went to celebrate le hub's birthday with 13 courses of culinary delights!\n\nThe Vibe: Intimate, modern, Japanese minimalist.\n\nIt's an extremely quiet, small, upscale space made even more formal by the fact that you can barely hear the conversations of the tables surrounding you.  Which is great for a nice romantic dinner for two, but for myself and le hubs, notsomuch.  We tend to get louder as the sake flows through our system so it's safe to say, we only ordered a small carafe, lol. Dress code is dressy casual as I wore dark denim with a nice knit and le hubs copied my attire.  Most other patrons were definitely dressier, men in sport jackets and ladies in cocktail dresses.  But LA dressy is always a little casual in my book.\n\nChef Nakayama is renowned for her modern kaiseki style of cooking.  A mix of traditional Japanese culinary art form that highlights seasonal ingredients and presents them in a way that's fresh, focused, and organic without seeming too forced.  You feel like she's plucked these elements straight from their natural habitats and presented them as an artist's self-portrait.  You can tell SO much about a chef by the way they handle their medium.\n\nOn the Menu: *Check post images for descriptions and individual review*\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nIt was pretty difficult getting a reservation simply from their online system so best if you email them directly.  Le hubs had been trying to get us in for months and it wasn't until I emailed n/naka with our sob story that we were able to snag a coveted Saturday night table just in time for his birthday.\nStreet parking is free and plentiful since they're located in a residential neighborhood.\n\nBe prepared to shell out an average $300pp for this tasting meal with alcohol guys. We typically never order the tasting menu with pairings since a few sips of various wines will have me zonked out for the remainder of the meal.  But if you're in the mood to splurge- definitely get the pairings.\n\nWine Pairings: $95pp\nSake Pairings: $105pp\nCorkage fee: $35 per bottle/ 1 bottle per 2 guests\n\nThey boast an in-house sommelier who sat with us for a good 10 minutes to decipher the bottle of sake that would pair best with our entire tasting menu.  Now that's A+ service!\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI spied between 8-10 servers rounding the 3 small rooms for this 52 person capacity space. Impeccable service- they don't miss a beat. Water refills, cold sake on the spot, they even keep your carafe on ice in the back so you don't have to reach for it table side. I'm not quite sure if most guests prefer it this way since they can't gauge how much alcohol they have remaining but I'm guessing it's to keep the floor as minimal as possible.\n\nOverall, excellent meal made even more so by the incredibly attentive staff and super friendly knowledgeable servers.  They even lined up as we exited the dining space and politely bowed while wishing us a safe drive back to Orange County.\n\nHas any restaurant in LA ever done that for you?\n\nHope you'll get a chance to visit them soon guys!\nIf you've been, what did you think?\n\nBon App\u00e9tit mes amis!\nSee all photos from Julie K. for n/naka",

I'm so happy for Chef Niki and her success, but boy for my selfish reasons I wish it was still a hidden gem.  Now the whole world knows about this place after her appearance on Chef's Table.\nIt was my hubby's first time, and we got lucky to get reservations for the day after Valentine's.\n\nEverything was to perfection from start to end. It got pricier from the last time I dined here but hey it's worth it.\nOur favorites must have been the Miyazaki beef and the toro sashimi and nigiri.\n\nChef Niki still remains humble and even remembered me when she came out to greet us. She even had notes that my Mom enjoyed her crab dish and said she'll make it the next time we come back. It will be a special treat when we go back.\n\nThis place is truly one of a kind.\nUseful 2\nFunny\nCool\n5/14/2013Previous review\nTook my Mom here for Mother's Day, and still this restaurant remains on my Top Restaurant in LA!  \n\nChef Nakayama deserves to be nominated for a James Beard award.  The creativity, uniqueness and flavors she puts in every dish is genius!\n\nMy favorite course was probably the abalone mentai pasta and lobster chawanmushi. The sashimi, toro tartare, matsuzaka beef, black sesame creme bruelee...well I guess pretty much everything was memorable.\n\nThank you Chef for the french macaroons and tulip! We'll definitely come back for another special occasion!\nRead more\n6/13/2012Previous review\nExceptional once again!  Took my Mom here for a belated Mother's day dinner and decided to treat her to the $165 menu.  \n\nWe enjoyed every bite, and appreciated the effort put into each perfectly prepared course.  Chef Nakayama is brilliant.  Her creativity is amazing, I don't even know how she has time to tend her garden.  Every ingredient was of high quality, she only uses the best.  I can tell she has great passion for what she does.  I am predicting this restaurant to be a Michelin restaurant in the near future, so well deserved.\n\nWhat makes the experience so special is that Chef Nakayama comes out to thank each guest for coming when they are done with dinner.  She even remembered my favorite course from the last time we dined there in January.\n\nUntil our next special occasion dinner....I must wait in anticipation :-)\nRead more\n1/6/2012Previous review\nI'm in love....\n\n.....with n/naka! How timely that I write a review about my new favorite restaurant on the day I receive my Elite 2012 Badge! This restaurant gets 10 stars all the way!  It's been a long time coming to experience such a delightful kaiseki meal.\n\nI've been wanting to check out this restaurant after the great yelp reviews I've read, the scrumptious photos I've seen of the food here, and KevinEats review.  So finally tonight celebrating a special occasion I got the chance.  \n\nI felt like I was back in Japan the moment I walked into the restaurant.  The decor had the feel of a restaurant I've been to in Japan.  We ordered the chef's tasting menu which was about 9 courses.\n\nCourse 1: tako (octupus) with cucumbers from her garden with cucumber foam and vinegar gelee and sesame sauce\n\nCourse 2: white fish and different mushrooms with a riesling shallot cream sauce\n\nCourse 3: hamachi sashimi with daikon and red beets accompanied with yuzu sauce\n\nCourse 4: assortment of sashimi - hirame, spanish blue fin maguro, kumamoto oyster with santa barbara uni, and hokkaido scallops\n\nCourse 5: crab with onsen like tamago in a broth in the roasted crab shell - this was heaven!\n\nCourse 6: lobster saffron risotto topped with tempura gobo\n\nCourse 7: wagyu on \"houba yaki\"magnolia leaf with sweet miso topped with foie gras\n\nCourse 8: assortment of nigiri - o-toro, tai, hamachi toro, santa barbara uni, spanish mackerel aji, and mirugai jumbo clam.\n\nDesserts: kabocha (from her garden) cheesecake rolled in graham crackers with burnt caramel sauce\n\nand\n\nmochi filled with black sesame sauce in zenzai like soup. I wanted more!!!\n\nEverything was amazing but my favorite was the crab broth dish, o-toro and the sesame filled mochi ball zenzai like dessert.  My least favorite was the mirugai nigiri - it was a little fishy.\n\nService was superb! The presentation of the food was top notch.  Chef Nakayama even came out to thank us for coming. Job well done.  If I could afford it I would come here every week.  The chef said she notes what every customer has so when the come again they get something different, definitely gives you a special experience no other places I've been to provides.  I read that the chef started her career under the chefs of Takao (one of my favorite places to get omakase) in Brentwood, however no offense but Chef Nakayama blows away Takao by far!  I truly appreciate her work and the details she puts into it, absolute perfection!  This place was actually more memorable than Urasawa...maybe because n/naka was so much more worth it compared to what Urasawa charges and it's been a few years since I went there.  Anyone that does not enjoy the food here just doesn't deserve to dine here, and better off with a McD value meal.",

My very thoughtful and amazing bf knew I love seafood, especially Japanese-style, and wanted to give me a very special treat for my bday. They had also just started offering a vegetarian menu so it would be a place that we could equally enjoy. We had reservations for 5:45pm on a Friday (reservations are a must), and luckily my bf knew exactly where it was--it has a truly unassuming exterior in an unremarkable part of town. Street parking seemed a little tight so we just valet parked it ($7 as of this writing). The restaurant is small, with very understated and soothing decor. This is a place to enjoy the food, not be a part of a \"scene,\" which was much appreciated.\n\nWe went for the gusto: the 13-course dinner with the wine pairing for me and the sake pairing for him. What unfolded over the next 2.5 hours or so was seriously the best dining experience of our lives. Each morsel was a work of art and my horrible photos do not do them justice. Some of the standouts for me were the beef/foie gras course (unbelievably tender, melt-on-your-tongue grilled beef and foie gras slices accompanied by a perfectly balanced sweet/savory sauce), all the sushi (esp the uni, of course) and the abalone cream pasta. I got to sample some of the bf's veg dishes and they were equally creative and flavorful, prepared with as much care and thought. The wine pairing was an awesome treat but it does end up being a lot of wine toward the end--I was seriously getting smashed, lol. The sake pairing was really interesting in that the differences between the various sakes were way more subtle so you really had to pay attention. The food and service were absolutely exquisite, and we got to meet the gracious Chef Niki afterwards. A perfect evening of many culinary delights; need to start saving my pennies for my next visit :)\n\nSTEPH JUDGEMENT: A truly elevated dining experience in a minimal, elegant and unpretentious setting.\nSee all photos from Steph H. for n/naka",

When I watched Chef's Table, I was fascinated with episode four on Niki Nakayama--the care and precision she takes in crafting her dishes and hospitality blew me away.  I knew I wanted to dine at N/Naka one day.  \n\nLuckily for me, my best friend is a huge foodie too.  For her bachelorette party, she requested we go to N/Naka while we were visiting LA.  We attempted to make reservations in advance to be decline and informed that they open reservations three months in advance for that future week.  At midnight, my friend's sister waited for reservations to open and managed to get us 9:15pm reservations for five on the Saturday that we are going to be in town.  It got booked up so quick!\n\nN/Naka is in the Overland neighborhood and it very inconspicuous, no signs...I would not have noticed it had I not seen it featured on the show.  They have pre-paid valet parking for $7.  We arrived fifteen minutes before our reservations and were seated shortly afterwards.  Our host/server came by to welcome us and took our drink order.  I wanted one wine that would go well with the entire menu and settled on a bottle of a Pinot Gris for the table to share.  After our wine was poured, the first course came out pretty fast.  I love that you get a description of each course as it is being presented and multiple servers are aiding each other.  Once the whole table was finished a dish, the proceeding course came out and there was no long wait in between.  Beautiful presentations and very flavorful food.\n\nIt would take me too long to go through all the courses but I'll give the highlights for me.  Scallops were fantastic, quickly blanched yet still raw and translucent--melt in your mouth.  The grade five Waygu beef, oh my god...probably the best piece of beef I have ever had.  No seasoning yet the natural flavor was intense. Tender.  Monkfish liver and Foie Gras are two ingredients I don't particularly care to eat yet I liked Chef Niki's preparation.  Monkfish liver mousse was clean and not oily at all.  The combination of strawberry, foie gras, mushroom, and unagi was ridiculously good.  It takes a lot of skills to make me like ingredients I typically will not eat.  All the food was appropriately seasoned, had a counterbalanced acidity, and texture...superior quality.  \n\nWonderful, wonderful service!  I have food allergies to crab and lobster and Chef Niki accommodated that with advance noticed, which I appreciated.  I am a little bit of a stickler about dining etiquette and their servers were on point.  Napkins were always folded when we got up from the table and water got refilled without picking up the glasses.  The small portions added up...I was content halfway through the meal, however, it was so good that I didn't want it to stop.  Eighteen dishes and three hours later, it ended.  To top it off, we got the honour and privilege to meet Chef Niki and take a picture with her at the end of the meal.  She came around and made sure everyone enjoyed the experience, beyond excellent service.\nSee all photos from Hayden N. for n/naka",

Everything, from the atmosphere to the service, especially the food, was perfectly balanced.\n\nMy family has been here countless times, and we have yet to have a bad experience. Each time we come, we have a different variation that is equally as compelling as the last. There's nothing to recommend because everything is always carefully selected omakase style by chef Niki. If they don't have a particular fish in the market that day, they will switch to a different to ensure fresh ingredients.\n\nSomething I always look forward to is the pasta dish. No matter what variation, it always is one of my favorite courses.\n\nCome here for a special occasion. We have shared many special moments here and can't wait for more to come.\nSee all photos from Michelle L. for n/naka",

There wasn't any one bad dish from the 13 course tasting menu she presented.\n\nA nice surprise at the end of our evening at N/Naka.... Chef Niki Nakayama came to our table & thanked us for dining at her restaurant & asked if  the food was to our satisfaction & if we were full.  She is so talented & so humble.

Beyond the high level and quality of her food, I can feel and taste the love and passion that Niki puts into what she does.  Yes, it's translated into each dish.  For me, this sensation is very rare.\n\nI had the privilege of dining at Niki Nakayama's gorgeous new restaurant during pre-opening.\n\nSpace:  gorgeous, intimate, serene, flowers, wood, beautiful.  Plus the chairs are so comfortable.\n\nThe food.  Niki knocked it out of the park.  Everything was really delicious, great flavors and flavor combinations, spot on execution, creative, plus very interesting presentations.  Loved the serveware too.\nWe had nine courses.  I should have taken notes, I'm not going to get them all right:\n- A sphere of liquid carrot, a type of Japanese carrot which has a more delicate, fresher flavor, topped with creme fraiche (IIRC), caviar.\n- Tasmanian trout (?) with a white asparagus cream sauce\n- a sashimi with fish liver cut into flower shapes\n- sashimi and oyster with housemade soy sauce!  and freshly grated wasabi\n- crab in its shell, a small type of crab, with broth and an egg\n- foie gras in broth with rice wrapped in a leaf on the side\n- my friends had really cool individual shabu shabu\n- I had duck being cooked on a leaf over some coals in front of me.  We determined our own level of done-ness\n- sushi, toro and one other\n- sushi smoked scallop and one other\n- red miso soup\n- sushi, maybe this was the Tasmanian trout, and blue crab\n- green tea souffle.\n\nOk I just butchered it.  Our waiter described everything very well.  I just have an information retention problem.  But don't mind me.  Niki's talent and skill are in every dish.  \n\nNiki has her own vegetable garden which includes hard to find Japanese produce.\n\nOur waiter was also at Inaka, and he was so gracious, with such good manners, funny, down to earth, and knowledgeable about the dishes.\n\nIf you dined at Inaka, you know what a wonderful intimate experience that was.  n/naka has the same warm intimacy.  The restaurant is small, and so you are not just one of the masses.  The prix fixe menu will change seasonally, and I believe Niki can change it up for you for multiple visits.\n\nOk, so wow, I just tasted that foie gras broth again, and the white asparagus cream sauce, and the other great flavors that are coming back to me in writing this.",

                  "review": "26 photos\nOh man... Where do I even start this review? N/naka owned by Chef Niki has been making headlines in recent months (featured on Netflix's Chef's Table) as she is the first female chef to really excel in traditional kaiseki. It took us six months to get a table here- we tried making reservations since September and finally got a reservation in November for March. Upon entering, we were greeted with a simple and elegant modern decor, and were seated once our whole party arrived. There are no menu options here- each course is a surprise which I really liked! We had about 18 courses total- 3 courses were dessert, 3 servings of sushi. Will try to minimize my review as I know my reviews get long-\n\nSaki Zuke (common and unique)- conch, konbu milk, potato pur\u00e9e, dashi foam with caviar and creme fraiche- nice light start to our meal. Dip the spoon with the caviar and creme fraiche in the conch and mix it in the soup. Delicious.\n\nZensai (seasonal ingredients appetizer)- this one came in a long tray of various items, and my favorite was the ankimo mousse. The mushrooms were packaged in a white cloth that you open and dip in uni butter which was unique! Lobster with dashi jelly was decent, and the grilled shrimp with yuzu aioli was very flavorful!\n\nModern zukuri (modern interpretation of sashimi)- Hokkaido scallop with yuzu and avocado sauce- the scallops were super fresh and chilled, and this was extremely refreshing and melt in your mouth. The two sauces that were paired added the perfect ending touch to the scallop.\n\nOwan (soup)- clear soup with sea bass, daikon, vegetables- I like how when you pick up the fish the daikon wraps that and the vegetables into a little roll. Soup tasted healthy which I really enjoyed and sea bass was tender.\n\nOtsukuri (traditional sashimi)- tako, kanpachi, tai snapper, blue fin tuna, amberjack, Kumamoto oyster- the sashimi was cut thinner than usually but it literally melted in our mouth. The blue fun tuna was my favorite, but quality of the fish was fantastic! I liked how the tako was cut in the shape of a circle, definitely reminds me of the tentacle portion. More tender than the typical cuts you get! Also- can't go wrong with Kumamoto oyster.\n\nYakimono (grilled)- unagi, saut\u00e9ed foie gras, shir take mushroom, balsamic strawberry- this is where I started noticing the complexity of all of Chef Niki's sauces. this balsamic was thicker than usual and was amazing! Of course, the unagi and foie gras tasted fantastic, but the balsamic really brought everything together.\n\nAgemono (fried)- deep fried black cod, beet pur\u00e9e- the fish tasted like Chilean sea bass as it melted in my mouth and was super tender.\n\nShiizakana (not traditional, chefs choice)- this was Chef Niki's specialty- spaghettini with abalone, white burgundy truffle, pickled cod roe, mentaiko sauce- for a non Japanese course, this was surprisingly the highlight of the night! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the mentaiko added a unique texture to the pasta. As the server said, it is not the abalone or truffle that makes the pasta delicious- it is how the chef prepares it. So true- this was my favorite course!\n\nNiku (meat)- A5 Miyazaki wagyu beef with beet chip, vegetables, 4 different sauces (watercress, squash, wasabi cream, one more)- again- the sauces were the highlight as it really completed the meat and veggies! Meat quality was superb of course.\n\nSunomono (vinegar salad)- Maguro, cucumber, wakame, lemon sake- this was an extremely refreshing palette cleanser as everything was chilled. A nice light contrast to all the heavier dishes we've been having!\n\nShokuji/ sushi- we got our tofu skin miso soup as well as three servings of sushi (two pieces each). Sushi selections included chutoro, needlefish, halibut, mackerel, Santa Barbara uni & ama ebi. Everything was divine! My favorite was the chutoro as it literally just melted- best piece of chutoro I've ever had. The SB ama ebi was a close second as it was braided which provided texture that was unparalleled to regular cuts.\n\nWe also got blue crab hand rolls as we could still eat, which filled us up. On to the three courses of dessert!\n\nFirst off- whisked matcha green tea with a blackberry sorbet. Perfect cleanser to our multiple course meal.\n\nThe main dessert consisted of a chocolate tart with coffee cream on top, toasted marshmallow ice cream, almonds. My favorite of the three! Loved the combination of everything especially the crunchiness of the almonds.\n\nGreen tea raspberry covered in white chocolate. More like mignardises than a course. Finishing touch to our amazing meal!\n\nService was exemplary throughout the meal- they explained everything and were extremely attentive to our allergies & such. Silverware was changed for every course, & plates were brought to the table at the same time. I love how Chef Niki is super humble and comes out to thank every table at the end of their meal. $210 per person- so worth it! (Maxed word count)\nSee all photos from Celine L. for n/naka",

And Chef Niki Nakayama really cares about her customers, coming out to talk to each of them after the meal. The restaurant is small and intimate. They have two seatings per night with staggered arrival times, and dinner lasts about 3 hours. The pictures of the food speak for themselves. The menu changes regularly, and Chef Niki never serves the same dish to her customers twice (except for her signature abalone spaghetti dish which is part of every meal). Highly recommend the sake pairing - sakes are generally rare and imported from Japan and really compliment each dish.\nSee all photos from Mary B. for n/naka",

Near the end of the trailer it introduces the chefs and their location. So when one of the featured chefs is located here in Los Angeles, I knew I had to make it a point to check it out.\n\nFrom the outside, one wouldn't have the faintest idea that what lies inside is a stage for modern Japanese cuisine. Chef Niki Nakayama applies her technique and creativity to refine the classics and put new twists to them. You can see and taste the care she puts into each dish. Everything has a purpose and there is such an attention to detail.\n\nThe setting is quaint and minimalist.  We had a party of 3 and such our table was set for three because everything is sourced and prepared for the exact bookings that night.\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and got into our humor which made the experience very enjoyable. Each course was presented simultaneously with a detailed description because there is no menu. The 13 course modern kaiseki menu is conceptualized by Chef Niki based on the best ingredients she can source and what she wants to create.\n\nIt is very hard to pick my favorite, but the chef's choice: spaghettini with abalone, pickled cod roe, and burgundy truffles was\ninsanely delicious. Very decadent and I only wanted a bigger bowl. Also, the Kobe beef was the best I ever had and the sashimi just melted in my mouth.\n\nIt was also such a pleasure to meet Chef Niki after our meal. She was very warm and kind. I had mentioned my excitement to see her in \"Chef's Table\" and she commented back that it was a very personal experience for her.\n\nMake sure to watch the docu series premiering April 26th and make\nreservations to N/NAKA on Open Table.\nSee all photos from Derrick K. for n/naka",

My parents have been here a couple times and I FINALLY got the honor to eat at N/NAKA as my 21st birthday gift [so you know I got that pairing]. Definitely pricey but everyone needs to treat themselves once in a while and N/NAKA is worth all that $$$$. My first initial thought was oh no I'm not going to be full and that these plates look really tiny..... Boy was I soooooo sooo wrong ...by the end of what took about 2 1/2 hours of just eating and drinking... I was to say completely stuffed. Everything was great! My favorite drink was the yuzu sake (so refreshing) that came along with the cucumber watermelon salad!!!!! I also really liked the A5 wagyu ribeye was so good (melts like butter in your mouth). And of course the signature dish the mentaiko pasta could have made me lick the plate clean. Honestly everything was great.. especially the service.. I'm left handed and the attentiveness to that detail of placing forks and spoons on the side of the hand that I eat with is spot on ... And I'm a total fan girl of Niki Nakayama ever since Chefs table. When I first saw Niki come out to thank the table next to us, I couldn't stop fan girling on the side. And when she came to our table she was so nice, kind, and funny. She even let me take a picture with her (a moment I'll never forget)!!! Just that little encounter touched me a lot and she is truly an inspiration.  Her creativity and care also shows in the food she serves. I really can't wait to come back.\nSee all photos from Reilley D. for n/naka",

I have had n/naka a while back but never wrote a review... until I looked at my pictures longingly and told myself it was time.\n\nI had n/naka back on Valentine's Day... I know this is extremely outdated but it says volumes about the food if I can remember how remarkable it was. We were offered complimentary champagne and seated. The restaurant has this very luxurious feel and although you are seated closely sometimes to the next table, there is an incredible intimacy that surrounds you.\n\nThe food was delicious. The food is pure and simple, and with such simplicity comes complexity. Because the food is simple, a level of precision it takes to execute it perfectly is required. Niki Nakayama nails that. I would discuss the dishes further but it might not be as relevant now since Niki will change her menu based on what produce is best. Just know that the food is worth the attempts at a reservation.\n\nAt the end of the meal they took a picture of us with a Polaroid camera and the server insisted we take another one because he thought the background was cooler in a different spot. Niki came out to talk to us about her dishes and restaurant which is something I really value from a fine dining establishment.\n\nPRAY TO THE RESERVATION GODS YOU GET IN!",

After watching chef Nakayama's episode on the Netflix series Chef's Table, I wanted to taste her cuisine for my own, and given her boost of popularity from both the show and excellent word of mouth, the wait time for a table (at the time that I booked the reservation) was two months in advance. Regardless of the wait, the dinner beyond exceeded my expectations.\n\nIt would take far too long to dive into each dish that was served on the day that I went, but what can be said in a nutshell from the dining experience is that it definitely stands alone as a titan of excellent cuisine. Heavily inspired by the traditional Kaiseki style of Japanese cuisine, the food is a masterful blend of new innovation and flavors that harken back to family style cooking. You feel at home with the food, as if you're visiting a friend in Japan and her family has decided to go crazy and prepare a feast for the occasion. In addition to the wonderful flavors, the staff that checks in and explains the meals are personable and friendly, respectful of your space and time to eat the meals accordingly, and speak very highly of their chef. You can tell there's a respect amongst the floor staff and the cooks, and it makes the overall experience memorable and impeccable.\n\nHaving chef Nakayama visit each table towards the end of her service was a delight as well! She's a wonderful woman, warm and friendly. I will definitely want to return to n/naka with an empty belly and open arms for the next assortment of meal Niki Nakayama serves my way!",

If you're looking to make reservations you should give them a call. I booked my reservation for 6 in November back in March.\n\nThe menu is a Kaiseki course which is a 13 course meal prepared in order, and we started with a escargot dish with foam. This was a great first dish to make an impactful and meaningful impression. Everything that followed, from the raw scallops to the wagyu beef was just decadent. Chef Niki does a fantastic job creating flavorful and memorable dishes. Each dish was very well presented, and all elements put into the dish was well balanced.\n\nI also did the wine pairing which fit nicely with the meal. I shared with my girl friend since I can't drink that much alcohol, but was still glad I tried it.\n\nI definitely recommend this place, and would come here again!",

It just goes to prove that she lets her food do the \"talking\" and every bite spoke to me! For a chef's tasting menu (which is what her modern kaiseki is), the price is very reasonable. Instead of a wine pairing, we opted for a really nice bottle of sake. I'm sure the food would taste great either way.\n\nThe staff was extremely nice and on top of things. When you come here, just be prepared. This is not a place where you get your plates one after another with no time to breathe in between. You actually get to savor your food and carry on a conversation with your date!\n\nAlso, for those of you expecting nothing but sushi, this IS NOT a sushi bar. Please go somewhere else for a 100% sushi experience. Besides, there's more to Japanese food than sushi. lol",

I made these reservations for my birthday on a Thursday night which was difficult to get to say the least. We were greeted and immediately seated. The restaurant isn't decorated with a bunch of frills which was a great contrast to the whimsical modern dishes and perfectly prepared Japanese dishes. The sake selection is large and you can easily find a sake to match you taste. From the starting scallop course to the apricot dessert, I was constantly impress with every dish. When they ask you if you was a hand roll towards the end of the course you say yes! Never skip the hand roll. Everyone in the restaurant ate those like they were a beautiful gift holding them lovingly. Chef Nikki thanks each guest that dined at the restaurant which is such a special touch. This place is truly worth every penny.",

I love all the 13 courses. My boyfriend really loved the wagyu steak and toro and I enjoyed mostly the sushi and sashimi dishes. An incredible dining experience with a female chef.

But the service is impeccable. The whole restaurant is set up to make you focus on the food. The courses were stunning in their sophisticated simplicity. The sushi and sashimi courses were relish and memorable. The appetizer plate was beautiful, and I wanted more.\n\nMy favorites...\nOMG, the chawanmushi with the most gorgeous flaky hairy crab (which chef told us had come in just that morning from Tokyo) was sublime. The consistency, the flavor...the subtlety of it is making me want to go back and spend the small fortune just to have that again.\n\nAnd Chef's signature Abalone Pasta was a revelation, and I SO don't use that word. The garlicky noodles, tender abalone, truffles...it was almost shocking in the midst of this light japanese meal, almost like I left and went somewhere else. But yet so smoothly transitioned in and out of. I just want to go back for that. And the Chawanmushi. Arghhh..\n\nGo. Just go. Worth it.\n\nAnd they treated me so so nicely for my birthday.

Every once in a while, you get a meal that transcends having dinner, and becomes an event.\n\nThe restaurant's decor reflects the food. Disciplined modernism based on traditional Japanese ideas, colored with a Western influence, but all done in a warm and inviting way.\n\nSince I don't drink alcohol, I cannot comment about the sake or wine pairings with the meal, but I will say that the meal was beautiful, dynamic, and felt like it had a narrative. Dish after dish got increasingly rich and creative, even though each dish had its own intricate layers of flavor and texture, and it seemed like it never let up until they bring out the sushi courses, which look so familiar, the unassuming fish on a little bite of rice. But then each piece is a perfect piece of fish, on truly exceptional rice. Surprises even in something as simple as nigiri. It all comes to a feathery end with the dessert, not treated as an afterthought in any way, but continuing and finishing off the story before sending you home satisfied.",

                  "review": "We were here for my husband's birthday. We had the modern kaiseki (tasting menu) and for every single of the 13 dishes in the course, it was just delight after delight. All the sashimi and sushi ingredients were very fresh; the broth and soup dishes were delicious. And of course, the heavenly steak and the mentaiko pasta with abalone and truffle. The desert was great too. We had the black sesame creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and flourless matcha cake. It came with a \"bowl\" of matcha - the real deal. You know, the whisk and powder kind!\n\nOne negative thing about our experience here is the parking situation - if you are a first timer here, you'd probably make the same mistake as us. Basically, there's valet parking for the restaurant, but as you turned into the parking lot, there's a sign with \"valet parking\" and there's another line below it - $7. At that point, our car was already in the parking lot and we felt kind of obligated to just suck it up and stay - which we did. As we stepped out from the parking lot, we noticed that there were plenty of street parking around. So if you're going to try this amazing restaurant - heads up for the parking trap!\n\nBTW, just wanna mention that we went to The Restaurant at Meadowood in St Helena 3 days before going to N/Naka. For the amount we paid for the tasting menu in Meadowood (which is a  Michellin 3-star restaurant), the value we got from N/Naka was much more .",

Make sure all of your credit card information is loaded into the app. Generally, you will be able to get a reservation 10 or so days out.\n\nIt is expensive but it is a once in a lifetime meal and experience.",

                  "review": "The Japanese word, Wabi used especially in Chado, the way of tea, perfectly describes the quiet, simple yet sophisticated interior decor dominated by natural stained wood that showcases the sybaritically nuanced & exquisite tasting cuisine created at N/Naka.  \n\nThis restaurant is like a small well-crafted jewel box whose jewels are the well finished dishes of comestible delights. The table for two contained a long rectangular tray containing small pebbles & a single striated rock.  It was like a mini meditation Zen rock garden in the guise of the famous rock garden at Ryo-anji in Kyo-to.  \n\nThe time was coming nigh for the illegalization of Foie Gras come July 1st in our great state of California, so the most logical decision was to come to N/Naka to partake of their 12 course Foie Gras menu with 2 palate cleansing courses.  \n\nOne would think that 12 courses of foie gras would be sensory overload, but I was willing to be the guinea pig to determine if 12 courses of foie gras would induce catatonic gluttony or at least an emetic response.  Unfortunately, there was no menu nor list of Sake or wine to refer to so this exegesis will have to be impromptu from my fast fading memory.\n\n1)  The first course was in a clear glass cylindrical cocktail glass which contained a foie gras custard as the base with a piece of foie gras grille on top, & this was crowned with a brilliant violet blue pansy flower with flecks of warm gold foil.  \n\nWhen I took the pansy off the top, the foie gras that was hidden by the flower was also  sprinkled with gold foil even though it was hidden by the pansy so that it would not be noticed by most diners.  Such is the care taken by the chef at N/Naka.\n\n2) Tranche of  Foie Gras Torchon was accompanied by small cylinders of brioche, fresh figs, compote of cherry, a smear of dark chocolate, & a small kyu-ri (Japanese cucumber) with its bright yellow flower still attached from the chef's home garden.\n\n3)  I believe it was sliced Kampachi Sashimi with crumbles of foie gras decorated with blue flower petals & microgreens.  An extra \"syringe\" of ponzu sauce was put on  the plate replicating an experimental laboratory.\n\n4)  Ultra thin slices of Hiram\u00e8 or halibut so translucent & silvery that when I put the green chive leaves under one of the Hirame slices, you could see the green leaves vividly.\n\n5)  Small Kumamoto oyster dressed with a bit of  Uni was a palate cleanser.\n\n6)  The Piece de Resistance was the poached foie gras with sliced black abalone in an enriched foie gras dashi soup, crowned with thin slices of green onion.  \n\nThe  foie gras & the abalone in the broth was a subtle interplay of richness & complexities of the sea.  The poaching of the foie in the dashi cleansed the foie of excessive oiliness that made the pairing with the abalone possible.\n\n7)  Seafood raviloi with finely diced chives and a foie gras infused light dashi sauce did justice to the fresh sweet shrimp & made it even richer.  \n\n8)  Ho-ba Yaki with Wagyu- beef & slices of foie gras in a red miso sauce was visually stunning with a huge Japanese magnolia leaf over a charcoal brazier in which the beef & foie gras bubbled and squeeked.  For me, the red miso was a little strong so that the Wagyu-'s flavor was eclipsed, but the presentation was rustically high class.\n\n9)  Palate cleanser of Su no Mono (Vinegared vegetables) with an accompanying Yuzu Japanese citrus wash.  I like the way N/Naka is not so orthodox that it uses different serving ceramics to hold unlikely ingredients.  \n\nThe striped ceramic with a top seemed to actually be a container for Japanese yellow mustard, so for those in the know, it was a mild surprise that it contained Su no Mono instead.  It's a way to let us know that we should keep an open mind & not get too set in our ways.\n\n10)  This is getting toward the conclusion of the Kaiseki meal which means that rice is coming up.  Six different kinds of Namamono (raw fish) in the form of Sushi were presented.  All the Sushi was pre-seasoned so that no Sho-yu (soy sauce) was required.  Of course one of the Sushi was foie gras grill\u00e9.\n\n11)  Soba noodles in a foie gras infused dashi soup was served as the conclusion.\n\n12)  Dessert came in 2 forms:  one was a light, refreshing citrus glace & the other was a creme brul\u00e9e of sesame.\n\nI did the wine pairing but unfortunately many of the names of the wines & Sake, which were quite appropriate to the cuisine, were forgotten by too many good things to eat.  However, the sommelier was quite good, & his method seems to be using wines & Sake that are subtle & nuanced in order to emphasize the Chef's food.\n\nThere is no grandstanding by the Sommelier, only a cooperative effort between the two principal partners in this wonderful interplay of sensory delights & culinary expertise.  N/Naka is truly one of the few dining venues in Los Angeles that is a temple to the culinary gods.  I believe I have partaken Ambrosia without having to scale Mt. Olympus.",

If that's what you're looking for, close this review and go to katana or katsuya). Don't call it omakase, it's kaiseki and the only place here in LA that provides this special experience.\nFrom the warm greeting when you walk in, to chef Niki coming out after your meal to personally thank you for coming, I cannot say enough about how much I love this place!  I won't go into detail about every dish we had, but it was like a beautiful parade, a well-planned experience that got better and better with each course! My favorite dish is the spaghetti with fresh shaved truffles... I could eat 9 courses of that and die happy! Every dish is beautifully plated, with only exceptional and organic, fresh ingredients (chef Niki uses ingredients from her ol very own garden; who does that?!) and the service is over the top excellent. They explain every dish being served in detail and are fully knowledgable about the preparation and will answer any questions you might have. They really make you feel like you're having a private dining experience (understandably so, since they only seat about 30 people in the entire restaurant). The fish is so exceptional, it practically melts in your mouth. The combination of the simplest but only the best quality ingredients made for such an amazing, memorable experience that we both thoroughly enjoyed. And to top it off, they took our valet ticket when we paid the bill so our car would be ready when we walked out. Such a nice touch. Now you come here for the entire experience, which I have no doubt you will LOVE; so be prepared to pay the price. We don't mind spending the $$$$ as long as it's worth it, so for 2 people, plus beer/sake, the bill was about $500, but it's an experience you won't forget. Chef Niki deserves a Michelin star, if they ever decide to bring them back to LA!\nJust some if the amazing courses we enjoyed!\nFreshest. Tastiest. Unbelievably amazing. Pure perfection.",

She combines flavors and textures like no other.  The prix fixe I had was 13 courses, and out of the 13, all 13 were delicious. Apparently Nikki does not care that 13 is an unlucky number. Maybe it was actually a baker's dozen.\n\nTotal meal took about 3 hours, so cancel any plans you had afterwords, unless of course, this was your Last Meal.  I'd recommend the wine pairing if it is.",

Then later, when I looked, it was sold out. Luckily, after emailing the staff, they were very accommodating and made space for us since I don't live in the SoCal area.\n(2) PARKING - I believe they have a parking lot and there is also street parking. It was fairly easy to find. The restaurant isn't extremely noticeable from the exterior so having GPS helps. We took Lyft and it was easy to be dropped off and picked up from that location.\n(3) SERVICE - The service was fantastic! They were very attentive with filling our waters, making sure we had all the equipment we needed, cleaning up the table, serving our plates in unison, and describing what we were about to eat.\n(4) FOOD - It was so delish! 13 courses (probably more since some of the courses had multiple pieces/plates). They were each creative and delicious, especially the fusion ones.\n(5) CHEF - She was so sweet! She came out to say hi to us and check to see how our meal went. I didn't expect it but it was still very awesome.\n\nI'd definitely come back again to see if I get different food and the creativity that comes from the chef!",

That speaks volumes.\n\nThere were so many flavors screaming for attention during the meal that no voice singly stands out, save to say that the Kaiseki style meal flowed beautifully from one course to the next and there was a harmony to the presentation, flavor and texture. In a way, it reminded me of Vinyasa Yoga where the instructor creates a program where one position moves to the next with ease- one is flexing a muscle and in the next pose the same muscle is stretched in relief.\n\nN/Naka is the standard to which I have compared all of my many sushi experiences and consider myself fortunate to have dined there.",

It's annoying to see people ding this place because they are not \"full\" after the meal or thinks it's too expensive or didn't get enough sushi, etc.  Those folks need to find the nearest Todai and don't ever come back.   I went with my wife and 2 other couples and we all agreed this was one of the best meals we've ever had.

A couple were very good, and none were average or less.\n\nMy favorites:\n1st course: egg custard with uni and abalone. First bite blew our minds.\n2nd course: The grilled octopus and the prawn was amazeballs.\n4th course: Seafood and broth cooked in teapot\n6th course: Poached egg inside hairy crab shell with freshly shaved truffles\n\nAll of the sushi was fresh. The different green teas were awesome, especially the matcha.\n\nWhat made it over the top? - the service!!!\n\nThe service was polite, friendly, and ridiculously impeccable. For example, they got our valet ticket at the end of the meal while we were still enjoying ourselves. We left the restaurant at our own pace, and there our car was outside waiting for us in front and paid for.\n\nNeed I say more?

This time we went we had to wait for 15 min before we placed the order. It was not too busy and we had to wait for long. They have so many choices it confused the heck out of me. I dont know of its a good or a bad thing. Our order came out within 10 min which made me doubt the freshness of food. I've tried their Laksa. It was mediocre. Mie Tek Tek was good except chicken didn't seem so fresh and was chewy. I ordered medium, but it was spicier. We also got chicken kroket, it was weirdly sweet. My husband ordered tofu rames . Everything on the plate was good except Tofu turmeric curry. After finishing food we had to wait for 15 plus min to get 1 to go box and another 10 min for check.  \nI would go back to this place if a friend or family wants to go, otherwise I'd be ok without it.",

It wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. The wait for our food wasn't too bad either.\n\nFor starters, we got the martabak telor and pempek. And for the main meal, I got the nasi bungkus. The martabak telor was this stuffed flat bread filled with ground beef, eggs and onions. It came with the orange sweet sauce and together it was sooooo good! The pempek is this fried fish cake and egg noodles drenched inside this sweet dressing, which was more like a broth. This one was okay, wasn't fan of the noodles too much. For the main meal, I got the nasi bungkus which consisted of rice, chicken, beef and vegetable curry mixed together and wrapped in banana leaves. The portion was HUGE. I couldn't finish it and had to take the leftovers home. It was a really good and fulfilling dish. I would recommend this if it was your first time here. Lastly, for drinks/dessert I got the es cendol, which is a coconut milk drink with rice flour jelly. I loved how it was really sweet and creamy.\n\nTheir parking lot is pretty small, and it's valet parking. There might be street parking around if you get lucky. Overall, I had a great experience here and would definitely recommend it if you're looking to try Indonesian food!",

For my drink I got the \"cendol\" which was so good it reminded of boba milk tea. Except its dairy free. For my appetizer I tried the \"Roti Paratha\" it tasted like half thin naan but crispy the curry sauce with it was sweet+salty. Yum! Lastly I tried the \"Festival Rice\" which includes rice in the middle chicken, noodles, eggs, potato tempeh, peanut and coconut rice. I ordered to have Martabak Manis as a side included when I looked it up it said was a pancake but i didn't see it so I dont know if it was included. ( Sorry no pictures I was starving! ) But the flavors were good I tasted more sweet throughout my dish and if you are central american when you eat the egg and the meat the flavors will remind you of home. Anyway it was good I will come back and try other plates! By the way the total of my 3 items+ an extra was like $30",

Honestly was craving good nasi goreng and the one here did not disappoint! Truly great stuff and the menu has all the classics you would expect. In fact the only thing missing (well, that I miss anyway) is soda gembira.. Terima kasih banyak!",

My boyfriend and I were debating between Korean noodles or Indonesian food. Since we've had Korean food before, we opted for Indonesian food and chose this place. We didn't know Buzzfeed made a video about this place (I still haven't checked out the video yet) so we were up for a treat! We walked in and waited about 15 minutes for a table. Every time a waiter walked by with a dish, it looked good.\n\nWe started with appetizers:\nChicken Sate - It's coated in peanut sauce with sweet after taste. I'm a very picky eater and I don't like peanut butter but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. He would even go back in for the sauce even though we finished eating all 4 pieces. ($7 for 4 pieces)\n\nDinner: We both ordered fried rice!\nMy boyfriend - Nasi Bungkus (the spiciest fried rice on the menu) I low-key think my boyfriend's taste buds went numb at some point in his life because he has a high tolerance for spicy food. Despite the waiter's warning, my boyfriend thought it wasn't too spicy. However, I thought it was really a spicy burst of flavor! The chicken and beef (I think?) were super tender.\n\nI ordered the Nasi Goreng Jawa - maybe I'm weak but my lips got numb and I drank two cups of water while eating this. Just wow. I didn't expect a simple fried rice dish to taste this good. It was really worth the experience to try something new.\n\nBoth fried rice dishes were savory. I wish they had a place like this back in my hometown SF. :( I would definitely come back the next time I'm in LA and try their other dishes. :)\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nEsther T.\nBusiness Manager",

First of all, they had complimentary valet parking which was great. When I walked in the restaurant, it had this nice aesthetic interior and it was very clean. The service is great there too! They explained how the dishes are served and they are always very happy. All the food is shareable and they give good portions of it.\n\nTo start, I ordered the Chicken Sate, which is chicken served on barbecue skewers with a delicious peanut sauce on it. The peanut in the sauce is not overwhelming at all; it is rich in flavor with a hint of the taste of peanut. The sauce is thick and creamy and it is very tasty. The chicken is cooked perfectly, not dry, not bland.\n\nI tried the Chicken Curry and it was really delicious. The curry sauce was thick, creamy, and had a hint of sweetness. As for the chicken, it was sooo tender and juicy. Not dry at all. Although I do warn you that the sauce is a little spicy. But it is not bad. To my taste, it was the perfect amount of spice. Not too spicy at all.\n\nI then also ordered the Kwetiaw Goreng which rice noodles, bean sprout and egg and meat, I ordered steak with this one, although there is a vegetarian option available too. This was absolutely delicious as well! The steak was flavorful and juicy, and I loved the texture and taste of the rice noodles, especially the seasoning and flavors the dish brought out.\n\nThey have a variety of different kinds of fried rice. They have fried rice with chicken, shrimp, corned beef, etc. which I found interesting. I went for the shrimp fried rice and it was very good. Great seasoning and very flavorful. Rice and shrimp cooked perfectly! I very much do hate very dry shrimp, but this shrimp was not dry at all.\n\nOverall I had an amazing experience here! Great customer service and great food! The prices of the food are very reasonable and not expensive. I very much enjoyed my meal here and I would love to come again and I recommend you try this out yourself ! Best Indonesian food in LA!",

Love the Rames dish\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool 1\n7/14/2019Previous review\nUPDATE:\n\nI had a horrible, traumatic pickup experience and am leaving a one-star review so that management will fix it ASAP. The staff is nice but management needs to fix this.\n\nAt 8:20 pm on Sunday, my family was starving so I tired to place a pickup order. First I went to Yelp where I've placed a bunch of orders before. But they had removed the ability to order from Yelp??\n\nSo I went on the Simpang website and went to order online. It took me to \"ChowNow\" and forced me to select a time for pickup. I wanted ASAP so I had to pick the earliest time option, which was 9:15 pm.\n\nI know the food only takes 10 minutes to make, so I arrived at 8:45 pm expecting the food to be ready. But it wasn't and it seemed like they hadn't started preparing it. So I wait around for 15-20 minutes like an idiot and it was finally ready at 9 pm (only after I told the staff that this was unacceptable and taking a ridiculously long time).\n\nIn sum their online ordering system is completely broken and they need to make it easy to order food to be ready ASAP. As it stands, it seems like the only way to order pickup is by calling the restaurant.\n\nThey need to fix this right away\nRead more\n6/2/2019Previous review\nThis place is close to our house in Cheviot, so we go often.\n\nWe absolutely love the Rames dish, and everything it comes with (Rice, noodles, fried chicken, beef, and green beans).\n\nBut the other dishes we've gotten haven't been nearly as good. Sort of too weird and ethnic and not as appetizing. Hence 4-stars instead of 5.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is nice and parking is limited but they offer free valet parking (tip only). Sometimes there can be a long line, so I wouldn't go during peak hours. Not sure if they take reservations.",

Everything is super flavorful with a good balance of textures and tastes between sweet, savory, sour and spicy (unless you get the spicy nasi bungkus as one of the yelpers mentioned below.... yikes).\n\nGot major food envy after the people next to us got a kwetiao (stir fry rice noodles) and cah kangkung (stir fry water spinach) that came out steaming and sizzling on a hot plate, so I'll definitely be coming back for that.\n\nEach entree has more than enough food for one person. I always end up packing a portion to go and walking off a food baby in the market next door.\n\nStreet parking is near impossible but there is free valet out front for busy nights (careful there might be a line for the restaurant too).\nRoti Paratha (half eaten... sorry)\nFestival Rice\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nEsther T.\nBusiness Manager",

Also, i expected more spices in the broth. The laksa at the Singapore restaurant stand at the Farmers Market at 3rd and Fairfax (the Grove) has more complexity of flavor than this place even though this place is fancier. Also, i made a mistake with my order. You actually have to ask for the rice noodle laksa (on a separate gluten free menu). I always thought laksa was traditionally made with rice noodles so was kind of surprised to see wheat noodles in it (which i cant eat).",

Nothing fancy but would rather spend money on good food than on the restaurant's decor, duh.  Friendly and fast service.  I glanced over Yelpers' recommendations and all dishes we ordered were a hit. Just wish the roti paratha wasn't so tiny (see pic).  The Kwetiau Goreng i.e. fried rice noodle was our favorite -- even better than the Thai Pad See Ew version.  Can't go wrong with the chicken skewers; I'd ask for the satay sauce on the side next time. Although very tasty, I didn't really like the skewers drowned in the sauce.  Would def be back for an easy and tasty dinner when I don't feel like cooking.\nSee all photos from Lily W. for Simpang Asia",

                  "review": "Simpang is a very good Indonesian restaurant, located in Palms in West LA. Being a vegetarian, I get either the Nasi Goreng Jawa (rice) or the Mie Tek Tek (noodles). Both are pretty tasty and filling and come with savory crispy crackers (I think they're called \"krupuk\"). Be careful with the spice in the Nasi Goreng Jawa, though; some of my Indian friends have cried while eating it ... Another favorite of mine is the somewhat redundantly named but absolutely delicious Roti Paratha. The bread is cooked to crisp layers and the curry that accompanies it is lip-smackingly rich and flavorful. After the hot and spicy meal, I usually finish it with their Thai ice tea which is decent. All in all, a great option for dinner if you're in the area ! I also recommend checking out the grocery store, you'll find interesting things like wasabi-flavored Kit Kat and what not.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool 1\nEsther T.\nBusiness Manager",

The wife knows how it should taste.  \n\nI know there are plenty out there like in OC that have rave reviews but we haven't been there, yet. We have  tried some in Alhambra and sorry Alhambra you just aren't close enough.\n\nThe spices and aromas are unique to Indonesian taste. Very different from Thai food.  Don't get them mixed up!\n\nPrices are reasonable.  Friendly service.\n\nDownside:\n\nLimited tables. Decors needs a bit updating. I suggest a little Indonesia look?\n\nTheir fancy dish plates are too big for their little tables so arrangement was difficult.

And this place does Indonesian, like a Finnish kid trying to cook Ethiopian.\n\nI ordered, upon the recommendation of our waitress (\"this is my favorite and our specialty!\") Mantep Padang (#002) Simpang fave dish, bold & deliciously spicy; Chicken curry, sambal beef steak, egg curry, kale curry, green sambal & rice.\n\nThe kale was so undercooked and tough it practically cut my tongue. The beef was tough like leather.  The rice was dry. There were shelled pieces of red chili skin in one sambal that had somehow fallen in.\n\nI feel bad leaving a bad review since there is so little choice of Indonesian food in Los Angeles. But if this is the representation of that cuisine in our city I would rather go without.\nUseful 4\nFunny 2\nCool 1\n3/23/2008Previous review\nWow! I brought a Malaysian friend here yesterday and he said it reminded him of \"home food\". This is an authentic Indonesian restaurant with both waiter and counter service and reasonable prices.\n\nI ordered \"Nasi Gudek\" ($6.95) which is served in a banana leaf and contains rice, sweet spices, slow cooked chicken, egg, tofu and jackfruit. It was delicious.\n\nFor a drink, I ordered \"Es Campur\" which is a big, icy bowl of grass jelly, coconut meat, red bean, palm and condensed meat.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean, bright, courteous. There is also a small market next door where you can buy SE Asian groceries and specialties.",

The dessert drinks are also all very good.\n\nIf parking is in short supply in the parking lot, you can always find plenty more up motor avenue under the highway 10 overpass, just a couple blocks away.\nNasi Mantep.

Not bad for a late night bite.\n\nLong story long:\n\nYet another late night, after work find.  During my search a couple months ago for late night places where I could grab a bite to eat after work, this place was suggested by one of my Twitter buddies.  He apparently lives in the neighborhood and mentioned this place is open until midnight.  It was nearby and freeway close, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nUpon pulling into the strip mall, it almost looked closed, but nonetheless, there were people inside.  When I went inside, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wait for one of the waitresses to notice me or just sit down, so I asked if I should just sit anywhere.  I took a seat and looked around.  Not much decoration.  Just a bunch of tables in a long narrow space.  Behind the wall I was sitting along is apparently the kitchen, and on the other side on the near end, a doorway leading to the market.  I couldn't tell if the market was still open or not, but there was seemingly a couple people walking back and forth.  The waitress came by with a menu and I asked her to bring me a water.\n\nNow, I'm not familiar with Indonesian food, but my friend told me to order something called the Nasi Bungkus.  Sounds like some sort of virus or weird Southeast Asian plant.  Just saying.  I also got an order of the lumpia semarang.\n\nA few minutes later, my food came out and it smelled pretty damn good.  But then again it was 11:30 at night and I was starving.  The lumpia were basically Chinese style eggrolls and even tasted similar to a Chinese dish I know.  It was the bamboo shoots.  I mean, Indonesian food has a lot of Chinese influence, so it's not all that surprising.  As far as my nasi bungkus, it was presented wrapped in a banana leaf.  I love dishes that come wrapped in something.  It's like Christmas any day of the week.  Half the fun is unwrapping it.  I opened the banana leaf to reveal a dish containing white rice, chicken curry, beef rendang (?), Balinese style egg, spiced potato with bits of chicken gizzard, and vegetable light curry.  And yes, because it's wrapped up in a banana leaf, this dish is not for people who hate having their foods touching other foods.  Just saying.\n\nAs I made my way through everything, it was all good and very flavorful.  The potatoes had a pretty decent spicy kick.  I would say my favorite part was probably the chicken curry.  But then again, how can you go wrong with curry?\n\nService was adequate, but then again at 11:30 at night when I just want to wolf my food down, I'm not really paying much attention to the service.  I would definitely come back and get the nasi bungkus again.\nlumpia semarang\nNasi Bungkus",

My wife's Indonesian cousin took us here when we hadn't eaten Indonesian food. By now, I think we've gone through the whole menu, because everything is delicious in such different ways, from savory to spicy to sweet.\n\nMy cravings: The Roti Paratha is to die for, even compared to the million Indian versions I've had. Arem- are here is solid. Sop Buntut and Sop Buntut Goring, the oxtail dishes, are delicious comfort food, and pretty uncommon. The tumeric and coconut rice is always perfect. Mie Tek Tek is addictive (we've ordered extra noodles to eat the next day a few times). Kwetiaw Goring is really nice. I can't go without a cool, refreshing order of Es Teler when I go, a shaved ice drink in a salad cup with jack fruit, coconut and avocado. Krupuk chips are nice too, again uncommon. The last two things I'd gush over (though really everything here is great): Pepes Ikan, a whole fish steamed in a banana leaf with shrimp paste, garlic and kale that's so tender you can eat most of the bones, and Ayam Penyet which is garlic fried chicken smothered in fried eggplant and a sambal relish.",

The flavors remind me of my Indonesian Grandma's cooking, very similar dishes and use of spices, much more so then the neighboring Indo Cafe (which is also quite yummy).  Also super cheap!\n\nThe nasi/rice combos are my favorite things to get, usually a choice of rices: plain, yellow (tumeric), coconut, or curry-soaked.  Then a jumble of about 5 sides - great variety, so no matter what you order you are trying so many dishes.  Ive tried half the menu so far and have yet to be disappointed.\nThe drinks/desserts are also yummy, several have shaved ice with coconut milk and various toppings like jackfruit, coconut, palm fruit, avocado, etc.",

                  "review": "I think this place is just okay. After reading the menu I was excited to try out the place but I couldn't really finish my meal. Tried the vegetarian banana leaf rice/curry/egg combo with a side of the fried bread with jackfruit dipping curry. It sounded so good but when it came (after a really long wait with only two other parties in the restaurant during lunch) it was ridiculously overly sweet and imbalanced. Everything was mushed together into the banana leaf (which just came rubber-banded in a ball) and formed a mess on top of the rice. The vegetable curry was just a bunch of mushy pieces of a flavorless melon-texture vegetable and a few carrots. Big pieces of flavorless tofu. The fried egg was dry and weird.\n\nProbably the best part of the meal was the iced coffee. Maybe the meaty food is good...but from a veggie standpoint I give a two. Restaurant setting is super-casual bordering on plastic lawn chairs, a few flies were hanging out. Service was decent, though.\n\nNote that the Motor Ave. Farmer's Market happens on Sundays until 2 if you're planning a visit.",

Food is always good, always fresh, with some spirit to it. Not factory food doled out to the masses, it really feels very much like individual care was taken in the preparation of every single dish.\n\nFor the Simpang newbie, they excel at fried rice and noodle dishes. Mie Tek Tek and the Veggie Fried Rice became staples with us very quickly because they are better than others in the area. The curries are also magnifico.\n\nVery much enjoying going through the menu slowly at this place. Thanks Simpang!\n\nP.S. Why four stars? While always tasting healthy and fresh, not every dish is delicious, and there is a total lack of vegetarian appetizers. We are about halfway through the menu now but our pace is slowing because we've started to reorder stuff.",

                  "review": "I came here to meet with some friends on a Tuesday night.   Boy was the parking difficult. Simpang Asia brought me stomach pangs from the hunger I felt during the 20 minute parking spot search. I ultimately ended up parking on the street, but it was well worth it.\n\nMy friends already had a table, so my wife and I were seated promptly. When we received our menu, I asked the waiter what he recommended. I don't think he understood me very well, but eventually he told me that the Padang sate was good. So, I asked for the Padang sate which is apparently a beef skewer, but to my dismay, the waiter said that they were all out of the Padang sate. Why would you recommend something to a customer, only to tell them that they don't have it? That's a big no no. Anyways, I'm quite forgiving and I ultimately decided to share three things with my wife: the chicken satay, Ayam Kalio and the Soto Betawi.\n\nAll three items were amazingly good. If you aren't he adventurous type, try the chicken satay. It's essentially a chicken breast meat skewer with some peanut sauce in the side. The chicken is tender and seasoned well.\n\nIf you're the more adventurous type, then try the Soto Betawi. It's a delicious soup that's rich with flavored. It's a creamy, beef broth with thin slices of beef, tripe and tendon. The soup itself is hearty because of the potato, but also refreshing with a crisp citrus aftertaste.\n\nThe Ayam Kalio was also delicious. Its essentially a baked chicken with curry poured on top. It has a slight kick to it without overpowering your senses. The chicken is tender, and the curry complements the chicken well.\n\nAll in all the the service was okay, and the parking was difficult, but at the end of the day, the food was excellent and at a more than affordable price. I'd definitely recommend that you to try this place, but read some recommendations about the menu on yelp before going in because if you have my waiter, he won't be able to help you make a decision.",

Once I try more dishes, I will most likely move my preliminary rating up.\n\nI decided to contact my good friends that are foodies and might I add started my whole journey on yelp. I figured we haven't had Indonesian food together so this was a good opportunity. Plus, I live across the street from here!!\n\nWhat\"s neat and a bit of a hindrance is it shares the building with a store. Therefore the restaurant has a cafe feel to it.\n\nOnce we were seated it took a bit of time for our server to come over. He was doing multiple jobs and I kind of felt bad for him. He was cashier, busser, runner, server and probably dish washer.\n\nSince it was cold out we decided to order the Kopi Tubruk (Indonesian style coffee). The best way to describe the coffee is unfiltered triple espresso in a big cup. It was served with syrupy condensed milk. The server warned us it was strong and he was not kidding. I actually had a small headache afterwards because of so much caffeine.\n\nSince I wanted to play it safe, I ordered the Nasi Rames that includes combination of chicken curry with braised tofu tempeh, beef curry rendang, and garlic green bean. The presentation and food portions were good. The chicken and tofu tasted great and the flavors were present as well.\n\nI had trouble trying to compare what exactly this food reminds me of... Thai?\n\nOne of my friends had Nasi Rames Padang which was somewhat similar including  padang style rice platter. beef rendang curry, young jackfruit curry, balado chilli chicken & egg, serve w/ padang style green chili relish.  He thought his meal was decent but he did not like his chicken as it was dry and not flavorful. I had a taste and had to concur. I did however try Jackfruit for the first time and was surprised how much it did NOT taste fruity lol.\n\nPrices were decent for what we had and do look forward to coming back to move my star rating to a solid 4.",

Their service has really gone up since then - and to be honest, I missed the faces that I would normally see [because they're awesome people].\n\nThey've stepped up their game in the market, and have a wider range of goods from SE Asia. For those of you from Malaysia and Singapore, you know that we live by Ovalette [an emulsifier/cake stabiliser] when we make kueh, and it's almost impossible to find in the US - - well, Simpang has it. I bought two small tubs and took it home. Happy am I.\n\nSimpang is stepping up its merchandise as well as its food. While I don't believe that gone are the days of portions in refrigerated styrofoam containers waiting to be heated up in the microwave and assembled for you before serving, I am thankful that the food is still better than anything else in LA.\n\nMaking a kuih lapis rainbow is a bitch... and as long as there isn't a Bengawan Solo in the US, Simpang is what I've got.\nUseful 5\nFunny 2\nCool 2\n4/15/2010Previous review\nI loved this place. It was my place to go for dinner when I had extra money. College students, you understand me. In spite of all their imperfections, this place was a staple for me. It was a treat to myself, and something I looked forward to. I pitched this place to everyone, including my roommates, friends, and family. I thought this place was a gem in the rough.\n\nWhen I needed certain groceries, it was a short drive from my apartment, and they were usually always stocked with what I needed to cook. I was happy with the price point, because it was competitive with Ranch99 and other Asian grocers.\n\nAt the restaurant side, I was alright with the fact that they make EVERYTHING in advance, and keep them in separate styrofoam packaged containers in the fridge to be reheated when they are ordered.\n\nI was alright with the fact that some of their vegetables are a little old and wilted.\n\nI was thrilled when they leased the space next door to expand their restaurant and their market.\n\n...but today, after years of being a patron of this place, I am a patron no longer. I was shopping for coconut milk and rendang powder when my ankle brushed the bottom of an overstocked display of black vinegar. A couple bottles fell, one hit my ankle, and the other shattered on the floor, just a few inches below. My leg was drenched in black vinegar.\n\nNot only was I embarrassed, but I smelled like hell.\n\nTo add insult to injury, when I get to the counter, the prissy guy with the highlighted hair [who always seems to have an attitude, which I usually dismiss because the people I usually see are very nice] CHARGES ME FOR THE BOTTLE I BROKE. THEN HE ASKS IF I AM ALRIGHT?",

                  "review": "10 photos\nIn what previously was a small market that sells food, this Indonesian establishment now provides an enclosed dining area with a pathway that extends into the market next door. The makeup of the market consists of few aisles where a number of pan-Asian snacks, condiments and produce items can be discovered. Their prices are a tad higher than their larger competitions, but the market seems to serve the neighborhood well where people can conveniently grab a bottle of soymilk and packs of dry snacks on the go.\n\nFellow Yelper Sri P. was the first to tell me about this place. The dining area was well lit, filled by a mixed crowd and Lakers fans that huddled in front of the large TV. I had the opportunity to try a small bowl of Sop Buntut ($5), a slow-cooked oxtail soup sprinkled with carrots and green onions. The broth was pleasantly light and tasty but there was only one piece of oxtail which was too lean and boney for the experience to be considered satisfactory.\n\nI also ordered the Nasi Rames Padang ($7.50) which arrived with a small serving of steamed rice surrounded by beef dried curry, young jackfruit curry, balado chicken, half spiced egg, and a spoonful of green chili paste. The rice plate was flavorful but servings were too small for me to give it a higher rating. The only piece balado chicken was small and boney, and adding to the disappointment the jackfruit curry was frail and unevenly heated. All together, I find the utilization of spices and dried curries both striking and purposeful, but unfortunately the amount of meat beneath it all was fewer than expected.\n\nFor dessert, the Pisang Bakar ($3.95) came with four pieces of grilled bananas topped with chocolate sprinkles, condensed milk, and cheddar. This dessert turned out to be a filler as none of the ingredients really stood out. I wasn't in awe with the combination of ingredients and the bananas could be grilled a bit longer.\n\nTo sum up the experience, the positive notes were not sustained for long but instead overshadowed by gaps and shortcomings. In many ways, I felt shortchanged in the end when price and value are considered. As a final analysis, the dining experience still carries all the signs of a fast food meal, especially when the portion and food temperature was the chief elements that rendered doubts to their ability to fully transition into a sit-down restaurant. The physical infrastructure is hip and refreshing to see, but it has to be matched with staff who can create the conditions to promote a viable sit-down experience. That said, service was absent as I had to get out of my seat several times in order to get what I needed. The problems I have outlined are easy to fix if given the attention to details. 2.5 stars for the overall experience. I'd be interested in returning to give them another try.\nSee all photos from Daniel L. for Simpang Asia",

I jumped when I saw the market section and wandered around. They carried the key ingredients to my favorite childhood snack: crazy yellow margarine and chocolate sprinkles (a dutch brand with a blue ribbon or crown).\n\nThis boy had heard many stories about the amazing food I grew up around so we ended up ordering quite a few things off the menu in our fit of food passion.\n\nThe gado gado was not to my liking, they put too much red sugar in it and the sauce had separated (oil from the rest of the ingredients). The rendang and nasi goreng were forgettable flavor-wise but created an unpleasantly unforgettable experience afterwards. Yes, it was that oily.\n\nLastly, the cendol, biggest disappointment. All of the flavors were spot on except for the salt. There was WAY too much salt and it overpowered the sweet coconut milk.\n\nThe market is a great place to go to, but stay away from the food unless you have an iron stomach.",

FInally, last night, I had the opportunity. We started with Bakwan (vegetable fritters-$3.95) for apps. These. were. phenomenal. Best I've ever had. I was so overwhelmed with all of the amazing and *CHEAP* options on the menu that it took me forever and 1 mind change to finally decide on the #5 Simpang Style: Nasi Besek..This was a combination with rice, shredded beef, chicken, curry pickels, liver, egg curry, spiced potatoes, long beans, and a few other things. I liked it enough, but I overlooked the Liver and was unpleasantly surprised when I thought I was biting into beef. This combo was $8.75, being one of the most expensive options on the list.. (YES!)\n\nWe wanted to try the sno-ice for dessert, but were too full. Definitely will be back soon, they have some very different toppings to choose from, I haven't been able to get them out of my head :)\n\nFortunately, parking isn't an issue for us because we live around the block. We did notice people have issues with parking and felt lucky to be within walking distance.",

If you are thinking of creating a curry or need some rice paper wrappers or chili sauce, you'll find a huge selection of groceries here to meet your shopping list.\n\nThe little refrigeration section has kaffir lime leaves, fresh chilis, and things that are hard to find on the Westside of LA. Some mangoes, limes, fresh fruits and such too.\n\nThis is a sweet little place that has a relaxed feeling with helpful and friendly staff.

Eggs got the Nasi Rames and I got the Nasi Gudeg. We also ordered Es Teler. I wish we ordered more food, but we didn't have a refrigerator in the hotel room to keep our food fresh.\n\nNext time, I will for sure come with an emptier stomach.\n\nOh - forgot to mention...they have an Indonesian grocery store right next door!

My friend and I doused everything we ate with the sweet Sambal they had on the table and ate everything in sight.  We actually had no leftovers and my friend just commented yesterday that we must have been some fat cows to have eaten all the food we had that night.  The portions are plenty here; I just ordered the Nasi Bungkus for take out yesterday and i couldn't even finish it.\n\nI also ordered the Durian Milkshake/Smoothie, which the first time was really strong which i like, bc I'm a fan of durian.  If you've never had durian, there's 2 things to know. 1) you either love it or hate it, there's no in-between and 2) it STINKS and tastes the way it smells but with a sugary sweetness.  some countries have outlawed durian in public places and even in hotels, bc the smell is so bad.  weird i know.  some people have claimed it smells like hell but tastes like heaven.  I unfortunately am one of those people.  that being said, i talked to the waiter and he said they actually use frozen durian--not as great as fresh, but still a LOT better than using powder. AND you can get it with boba if you want to :)\nThough i ordered this yesterday as well and it wasn't as strong as the first time, but it was still good.\n\nat the counter they also have empanada like pastries, that I think i'll have to try too. also they no longer have lumpia :(\n\nIf you're meeting up with a friend here and have some time to kill while waiting, the restaurant is connected to an asian market,so u can explore and grab some groceries while you're here.\n\nDefinitely, thinking i'm going to be a regular here.",

The portion is a little small but again I'm extra large so it should be plenty enough for regular size folks. I'm not big fan of the green drink with wigglely stuff in mine so I cannot comment on that. Their Thai tea is average, their unfilter coffee isn't that great, taste like water.\n\nI already get the parati or whatever that bread with curry dipping sauce is. It's not the cheapest since it's like 4-5 bucks for 4 tiny pieces. But they are quite good.\n\nThe grape leaf rice things are my favorite and they are just mixed of deliciousness!\n\nLast time I was there, I got a fried honeycomb rice. Good stuff. My friend was judging me because he doesn't eat that stuff. However, I love it.\n\nAn unfortunate incident happen though..... I found a piece of aluminum or stainless steel thing that you use to scrub the pans in my fried rice. However, the guy handled it very well. He was sincerely and genuinely sorry and I get it, mistakes happen. I was that mad but my friends were furious about it. I understand shit happens and they were so sorry and took that item off the bill so I forgive them.\n\nI will come back but probably get the grape leaf wrapped thing, just in case if I got the stainless steel scrub thing ;)",

Actually, if you want to be dumped but yet have a pleasant meal, this is the place to be. Serves lunch and dinner if you want it low key on the West Side.\n\nThe lower than four rating is because my dinner companion was kind of sketched out by this place even though she picked it (though in her defense she has been working super hard at work, studying at home, and on cold medicine, *cough, cough*).\n\nThe food was actually quite good. My dinner companion and I shared the Nasi Uduk Jakarta (rice with coconut and lemon grass flavor) and Nasi Bungkus (banana leaf rice). The Sop Buntut (oxtail soup) was okay mostly because it was served room temperature instead of it piping hot. For cold drinks, we both got the Es Teler (sweetened coconut jelly). Bill came to a grand total with tax of exactly $29.99 (no lie)!\n\nNow where are the Hot Dog on the Stick girls? Oh wait, this is not a food court...",

The only downer was that they had a free soft drink offer on Yelp that we were informed by the server was one offer per table.

Even though most of the dishes aren't as spicy as I like it, somehow it was still super tasty!  The corned beef fried rice had tiny shreds of corned beef and egg that were married well into the rice and packed a punch of flavor.  I had the lunch special of beef rendang and rice w/ soup for a whopping $5.00 and boba was like $1.50? Also, the collard greens in some coconut curry base sauce is amazing.  Ginger coffee had a tangy twist to my morning joe and if only I had space I would have also ordered the fresh coconut juice that comes in a fresh coconut.  I hopped over next door to pick up a bunch of ultra cheap groceries and hard to find asian ingredients.  Tropical juices like soursop, lychee, guava, mango, coconut, all in the little mini grocery store.\nThis is so amazingly delicious and cheap, best part about this place is that the food tastes cozy homemade like you are at your indonesian's friend's house.  I don't have any, but I imagine that's how it would feel!\nNext door I found some black sticky rice and coconut sauce, if only mangos were in season!",

Made the exit and meant to find the way back to 10 East - but we bumped into the Farmer's Market in front of the restaurant.  It was a good lost as we had very good lunch @ Simpang Asia.\n\nStarted with Otak Otak, came in 4, and they were good.  We shared Nasi Bungkus, which was really tasty and made hubby very happy.  We also had Sate Ayam along with Nasi Bungkus - they were good.  They were made with chicken breast, with good peanut sauce and topped with fried-shallots, yum. . .\nWe ended with Es Campur, which was refreshing as outside was started to get warm.\n\nThe service was pretty good too, they were pretty attentive, and we didn't wait that long to get our food to be served to us.\n\nWe definitely will come back soon as now we know there is a good Indonesian's food near Beverly - our fave's little \"get away\" for weekends.",

When I moved to the area, I usually came for groceries since it has my favorite instant Ramen soup (Neoguri) in bulk packs.  I recently tried lunch on the patio and it seriously became one of my new favorite lunch spots in the neighborhood! I'm new to Indonesian food and so far I'm loving it. I can't remember the names of my dishes (sorry!) but I can't wait to keep coming back until I do ! The only qualm I have about it is if you're eating out on the patio, which has these great picnic tables, you'll have to flag down a waitress to serve you. But either way, it's worth it.",

The quality of food goes down a notch each time I visit and there's a wait person there with an odd sense of entitlement.   Sop buntut was nothing more than a piece of carrot, a one-inch square of meat and salted water.  If you have the peanut sauce on the side, the siomay looks and tastes like the rubber from your shoes.  Ayam penyet and croquette are the rare standouts.  If you want quality indo food, I recommend taking a trip to West Covina's Indo-Malay food court.",

Roast their own beans and sells a variety of teas and pastries. No wifi but not really for you to lounge around all day!\n\nMost other people like their speciality drinks like lattes and mochas, but the americano is really on point for me.\n\nBaristas are all very very nice and neighborhoody.\nLarge Americano ($3.00)\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n3/16/2014Previous review\nOne of the nicest iced coffee I have had. Usually I just get the Americano. Nice turkey croissant pastry. I also like the Cinnamon Roll with pecans on top.",

Because I love it and it makes me feel warm and fuzzy and I can't help myself.\n\nThey simply don't make 'em like this anymore. In a city of yoga pants where everything is hip and modern, Conservatory stands alone as a friendly, wi-fi-less, conversation-ful coffee spot where everybody knows your name. And I like hip and modern and even yoga pants. But I didn't know what I was missing until I started coming here.\n\nYou won't find exposed concrete and beams, or subway tile or pour-over or the latest greatest siphoning technique. You won't find med-school kids cramming or young folks launching their next start-up. Instead, you will find wallpaper and newspaper, folks playing cribbage (or something), discussing politics, discussing coffee, and a never-ending supply of charm.\n\nAnd I haven't even mentioned the coffee and tea. Both are fantastic. I normally just get the brewed coffee, which is roasted in-house, always delicious, always flavorful, and different every day. Sometimes I'll go for an espresso drink if I happen to get there early enough to beat the espresso line (if you just want regular coffee, there's a separate, much shorter line). I've gotten a few tea varieties, including the chai latte, which is made from steeped chai (not the super sweet yucky powder) and a pot of white tea, which was served beautifully.\n\nI guess an appropriate bottom line is this: Whether I'm just grabbing a quick cup, sitting down with a book on a Saturday, or meeting a friend, Conservatory is the best part of my morning.\nGet the merch on\nCappuccino yums",

I didn't get a chance to see the reason why because my view was blocked. Anyways it took us almost 15 minutes to get our order taken. My boyfriend and I were the first ones in line too. We were just standing there waited to be greeted or acknowledged by an employee. Every barista was doing their own thing (at least 5 behind the counter). Another customer who obviously was there before had a pastry that he ordered (maybe they forgot or something) and had to pay. But the barista that was helping him out just stood at the register and made eye contact with us and didn't say anything. Like really? Not even a \"Sorry, we'll be with you shortly\" or \"Sorry for the inconvenience\". And then she didn't even bother to help us after the customer paid for his pastry! She literally just walked away and had to wait for a few minutes for another barista to notice us. From what I saw, I think each barista gets their own customer and they make the drinks for them and help them at the register. When you have 15 people waiting in line, that definitely is not the best way to handle a group of customers, especially if you're closing for the day soon. At least our cold brew and cappuccino came out in less than 5 minutes.\n\nThe store does have a lot of things going on. People outside or inside reading/studying/talking to others or the decorative tree on the inside and the merchandise along the wall. And all the teas in the containers along the wall that go up to the ceiling.\n\nWhat I did like is that there's a separate line if you just want a plain cup of coffee. I think that helps both the customer and barista so you can efficiently get the line moving.\ncappuccino",

Their coffee is consistently on point and probably the cheapest you'd find on the westside. There's some free parking if you enter in the small opening next to the coffee shop. Otherwise, there's metered parking out front. There's some seating but the inside is usually full when I go, although there's usually a vacant table or two outside. It's a bit noisy and bustling so not ideal if you need a quiet place to study/work but fantastic place for a nice coffee break.",

A great way to have accountability and to ensure you are taken care of properly. All coffee shops should be run this way, and I have ran coffee shops. Everyone is friendly and personable as well.\n\nI order an extra shot to give it a little more coffee flavor and yes it is a sweet mocha but the flavor is so creamy and amazing, but I guess that would have to be your thing as I've seen others say it's too sweet. They do have their own mocha powder made for them, so it is special and bomb. Apparently you can buy it from them too.

I walked through umbrella-ed tables into a warm shop playing live music! In the middle of the day, so nice. The hallway to the back is lined with huge bags of beans. As I waited In line, which was legit, I heard conversations of recognition and meet ups and regulars. I recognized people here and they echoed the love of this place that is evident when I walked in. The yelp reviews will also sing the praises of this place. Customer service is unique and awesome, each person, as they step up to order, gets their own barista. Carla was the great barista that helped me. They handle an order from start to finish. Greet, take drink order, make the drink and rings you up. So three of us at least are being helped simultaneously. I had the organic Brazil house blend. I had a triple shot oat milk latte. It was perfect. Every drink I wish could be this good. Layered, buttery and Carmel-ie. super smooth no bite but full on my tongue. Sigh! So worth it! Again thanks Carla! I know I have more to say...if you want to fully enjoy yourself while having a fine beverage, Conservatory of coffee is the place. Don't wait! (Though it's worth it ). #emandhercoffe",

My caffeine fix was not satisfied and so I was on a mission to get more espresso in my system. After a little yelping, I stumbled upon Conservatory For Coffee, Tea & Cocoa.\n\nAmbience? Think The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf meets Urth Caffe with a tree ripped out from Rainforest Cafe and transplanted in the corner.\n\nI have a fond appreciation for Conservatory's noise level, as their patrons practice using their inside voice, a stark contrast from the loud uncontrollable cackling many patrons at Urth Caffe emit.\n\nRunning the bar and register were two very kind mature ladies.\n\nAll their pastries looks so tempting and I couldn't resist, so in addition to ordering a Large Lowfat Caffe Latte, I also ordered a Blueberry Bran Muffin.\n\nLarge Lowfat Caffe Latte: 4/5\nThis caffe latte was a better cup than the one I had a hour before at Paper or Plastik Cafe. Conservatory's espresso shots have an acceptable level of sweetness, but not the same level of Intelligentsia. Bitterness was minimal and had a clean finish with pleasant aftertaste.\n\nBlueberry Bran Muffin: 4.5/5\nQuite possibly one of thee best blueberry muffins I've had with generous amounts of blueberries. I did not mind the dense bran muffin because I had not eaten anything all day, so the muffin in conjunction with the large caffe latte completely filled me. Finally, this muffin was not too sweet.\n\nI forgot to mention. I parked about 1/2 mile away at the parking structure on Cardiff and Culver.\n\nConservatory gains my stamp of approval. If you're in the area, there are a few choices for coffee, most notably Starbuck a few blocks away...but why would you want to go to Starbucks when you can have a much better tasting product at a similar price point in a much more calm environment?\n2% Caffe Latte\n2% Caffe Latte & Blueberry Bran Muffin",

I had the opportunity to live in West Los Angeles for about 4 months.  The very next morning upon my arrival, my extensive online research lead me to this place.  I knew it must be some kind of awesome when I drove by and there was a line of about 10 people going out the front door.  The shop has a super comfortable \"lived in feel\" and an eclectic mix of local loyalists.  While the line was long, it moved quickly and the baristas all seemed like family who love what they do (it does happen to be a family owned business).  During my four months there, I was a weekly patron...making it my first priority every Saturday morning...and it never disappointed.  The baristas were always friendly and warm and demonstrated a great level of skill and care in every drink they created.  Just for research purposes :-)...I managed to try out four other highly recommended coffee places, but none of them...particularly when it comes to the tasty beverages (I always get an almond milk latte).... compared to the Conservatory.  If you're serious about your coffee...go here...you'll be glad you did.",

This place is cozy, spacious, exudes coffee and the employees are all DARLINGS...unlike most condescending baristas. The owner (AJ) doesn't hire his baristas based on what ironic, slim fit, tattered corduroy pants they wear. He hires kind hearted and tentative individuals because he is a kind hearted and tentative individual. The coffee there is just awesome! He roasts it all in house! As soon as you step in the place you are met with a gigantic coffee roaster. They have a wide variety of different roasts and beans that are actually FRESH. Unlike store bought coffee that is usually way past its prime. The Conservatory is just the best. Go there, you wont regret it!\nI give them a strong 5 stars.",

There was no long line, I did not get waited upon in an orderly manner. NO, I got passed over twice. Yes, Twice. I even had to raise my voice and ascertain that I was a living breathing alive human standing in line. You know how that makes you feel. Very bad. Seriously, slow line and being passed over. Horrible feeling. Whoever was on shift today. Get your head out of your ass. If you're not feeling well tell someone. But the service today is appalling.\n\nAlso, Los Angeles is a diversity. If you can't understand how I'm speaking, ask again. But don't snicker to the side or look over at other coworkers with your eyes raised. Or better yet, if your reading this and English is not your first language DONT COME HERE!!! Go somewhere, where they will take time with trying to understand you.",

This is just hands-down the best place for coffee. $1.95 for a large cup of strong, delicious coffee. Any kind of artisan espresso beverage, plus a whole host of teas which change out regularly. Everyone who works there is so nice, and it's a very friendly and warm environment. There's also a regular coffee line if you're in a hurry and don't want to wait behind everyone getting some crazy espresso drink.\n\nA few minor downsides, although not enough to mar the 5-star review: (1) if you want a large iced coffee, it's a dollar more. Not sure why the 33% increase from hot to cold, but whatever. (2) They close at 6 pm and aren't open on Sunday. Given that I want coffee all the time every day, I find this to be mega-inconvenient, but I let it slide since they're family-owned. (3) I sometimes give bags of their coffee beans as gifts, since they roast everything on-site, but it's like $15-$20 a pound for their coffee. Which means I only give it as gifts, and never buy it for myself.\n\nTIP: I think the yelp page says it has street parking, but I would highly suggest you don't park on Washington. It's a nasty corner. Instead, turn onto Jean Street (right next to the Conservatory) and park in the free lot behind the shop. You can enter from the back. It does get quite busy, especially on the weekends, but someone usually leaves quickly enough.",

                  "review": "Randomly found this place while driving around Culver City. Luckily, this place had awesome Yelp reviews, so I had to try it out. Parking might be a little of a pain, but just look for the side streets and you should be fine. There's plenty of seating here; couple tables outside, and around 5 inside.\n\nApparently this place is known for their Mexican mocha. One of my friends decided to order one, while I went with the classic cappuccino. Similar to Starbucks or any other coffee shop, there are 3 sizes to choose from. S, M & L. As far as prices go, they're pretty standard, roughly $4.\n\nThe Mexican mocha was actually pretty good. It had a cinnamon spice to it, giving the mocha a unique taste. It wasn't overly sweet, and had a nice creamy taste to it. My cappuccino, on the other hand, was amazing. Even with an extra shot of espresso, it tasted like cream. Normally, I like getting the extra shot of espresso so that I can actually taste the coffee, but it was completely masked with this cup, and in a good way! As an extra perk, the baristas here make that nice espresso leaf over the foam of your drink. Common, but I still like it.\n\nIn addition to all their espresso drinks, they do have a plethora of coffee beans that you can choose from, as well as drip coffee. Unfortunately I did not get a chance to buy beans, nor try the drop coffee.\n\nConservatory is probably the best coffee house in Culver City. Do yourself a favor and ditch the Starbucks for a real coffee house.",

It's a popular place for friends to meet up and the tables fill up quickly. In the mornings there's a line of regulars and a super friendly staff behind the counter. They're efficient so long lines don't mean a long wait.\n\nThe coffee is good, but not amazing. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of this place, and it's certainly the best in Culver City..... but I don't feel their coffee holds a candle to Intelligentsia or Urth. Still leagues better than Starbucks and it does the trick.\n\nThe baked goods on the other hand. Amazing. I can't stop thinking about their raspberry polenta scones which is what I almost always order. Soo good.\n\nIf you're in Culver City, the Conservatory is a nice place to slow down and grab that nf dbl cap.",

They take pride in their work and in preparing your coffee. They even have a coffee bean roaster on site. Baked goods and pastries are awesome especially the chocolate and almond croissants and the scones!!! But my favorite thing to get there is their Vanilla Latte. It has the right amount of creaminess and flavor to say it is the perfect Latte. It tends to be on the sweet side of things. SO i like to think of it as my dessert treat in the morning. And also to note as if the taste isn't good enough, the barissas will make it look visually appealing as well with some Latte Art.  \n\nIf you want to stay on the non-sweet cafe side of things, their coffee and all their other espresso drinks, teas and cocoa are equally just as delicious!\n\nSo yah, skip the Starbucks! If you want a quality and reasonably priced coffee shop, THIS IS THE PLACE!!!\n\nOH and if you see a line, stay in it, it is SOOO worth the wait.",

It was smooth with the right amount of sweetness but thankfully without the usual nasty fake sweetness that is characteristic of most frapps from other joints (coughStarbuckscough).\n\nMy only complaint is that it was so good I slurped it down incredibly fast and I was left coffee-less while I finished reading my book.",

Let me set the scene: On Washington Blvd, an artery that runs east / west across the City, there are dozens of cafes and coffee shops and places that have coffee on their menu. From the big chains like Starbucks and Coffee Bean to smaller spots like Cognoscenti to the panaderia with excellent dulce de leche. There is no shortage of good coffee in the area. Period. What the Conservatory brings to the table is heart and soul and love. Real love. Like, cry your eyes out in the rain it's too-good-to-be-true LOVE. This place stands out above the rest and rarely if at all EVER makes a single list of \"best coffee in LA\". I have read nearly all those lists and have been to Go Get Em Tiger and all the spots in the Arts District (Blue Bottle and more) and everything in between like document coffee in Koreatown. This place still stands out. I measure every other coffee shop against the Conservatory. All the new hip and trendy spots all taste the same and rarely do they much to separate themselves from the pack. Perhaps fear of going against the grain or the lead of the pack, I don't know! Listen, I've wasted enough of your time with my mediocre writing and raving and ranting. Get off your ass and make your trip to Culver City. Order a vanilla latte. Grab a rose hip tea.

I never saw it though and am embarrassed to admit I drive past it most days (either go to school via Venice or Washington, whoops).  I was pretty disappointed with the coffee shop in my area- Paper or Plastik, and was mad that there wasn't a place within walking distance to drink and study.  This place blows it out of the water.\n\nYelp doesn't let me do a table format so here goes:\n\nP or P- coffee is about $3.50 for a small cup\nC for C- coffee in my large reusable mug- $1.60 and roasted right there.  And much better tasting.\n\nP or P- snooty hipsters working who never seem to know the answer to any questions.  associated with a renegade Eastern European dance artist (usually this would be a good thing, but for some reason, here it's not)\nC for C- very homey, not just kids working.  One woman reminds me of an old aunt-like teacher.\n\nP or P- weird rules about no computer use at 1/3 of tables.  Often no tables left except for those, and this always happens when I procrastinate and need to do internet stuff for school.  Strange\nC for C- no one cares what you use, and not too busy when I've gone.  Then again no wifi suppposedly, though I've gotten it there. Outside seating on Washington doesn't feel like a wasteland like on Pico.\n\nC for C- insane bonus points since I am also a musician, have run into/met a lot of the top studio guys in town who crash for lunch here or the decent Italian place next door when recording at Sony across the street, which is starting to translate to gigs for me (yay)\n\nI can't walk here but once I get a bike happening, no problem.  In the meantime I am surprised to have found parking within a block every time.  You just have to watch out if you are staying longer than an hour.",

It's like a chronological display at a museum because right before the roasting are the bean sacks, at one time they even had a coffee plant! You literally can see the progression of a coffee bean turning into your espresso. AJ is extremely knowledgeable & I purchase whole beans from him.\nI've had coffee in Europe, Seattle, SF & the conservatory is it for me in LA!

I'm generally looking for some form of vanilla latte and, iced or hot, I can't tell you WHY but truly prefer the lattes here to any of the chains in town.  I also enjoy the cozy atmosphere - unfortunately, so does everyone else, so depending on what time you arrive, it can be tough to find somewhere to sit if that's what you're looking for.  The baked goods seem overpriced, so I haven't tried any of them yet, but the only real negative I have is that they're closed on Sundays.

They have two locations, I came to the one on Venice blvd, being also the larger of the two spots.\nMy party of two dined outside on a nice early evening and was greeted by a waitress fairly fast. We ordered the Chicken and Pork combination plate, which came with moros y cristianos, and plantains. In addition, we had to try the famous Cuban sandwich, which came with fries (I wish I subbed these for a different side).\nThe food came out fairly quickly and looked absolutely delicious. The pork was underneath the chicken, sucking up all the succulent juices from the dark meat, and the pork was swimming in a pool of what tasted like the lemon marinade which they use on the meat. I was happy to find that neither meats were dry, both had a great amount of juice in the tender white and dark combination of meats. The onions got drowned out by the lemony flavor of the chicken, and the pork was one note, but those notes prevalent were good. Sometimes less is more, and that's okay! My favorite thing on this plate was actually the two sides, both being absolutely delicious and a perfect complement to the acidic and rich meat. Onto the sandwich, I was whelmed. Although I can say it's the best Cuban I've had, that fact comes along with the underlying note that I have never had a Cuban before this. The sandwich had too much fat for my liking, in terms of the grease which came from the meat and cheese in combination with the butter and mayo. The quality of all the ingredients was great, and the flavors were good, but after a few bites, it didn't really feel like anything unique.\nI had a wonderful time coming to Versailles and everything I had tasted good. In the sprawling Los Angeles world of amazing food, I wouldn't say this needs to be on your list, but if you're looking for a good, quick bite to eat, or simply just love these Cuban flavors, then I'd recommend you try Versailles out.\nPork and Chicken combo\nCuban",

It has this look because it HAS been around longer than most. This is a very big plus when looking for great chow.\n\nThe service at Versailles is incredibly welcoming and prompt, recommendations are on point, and I honestly wish I could hire the bartender to follow me around making mojitos for me every day for the rest of my life.\n\n7 of us sat down on a Saturday evening with no wait time issues at all. We ordered and food arrived hot and very quickly, no sitting and waiting, wondering if your food was drying out under a heat lamp. I got the classic roasted pork and it was one of the best pork dishes to ever have hit my plate.\n\nI also got a piece of cheesecake, but it was gone before a picture got taken. Very smooth, very creamy, with a sweet caramel sauce drizzled over the top.\n\nIt's a shame I live nearly 40 miles away, but probably good for my waistline because if I was closer, I'd be here daily.\nMojito\nFS-Lechon Asado (Roasted Pork)",

I enjoyed the atmosphere and their outdoor seating in the morning.\n\n1- their adhering to the coveted precautions upon entry but once you reach your seat you are free to do as you wish. We dined on the outside patio and it was really nice honestly for the morning. They did a pretty good job of creating this kind of floristic wood terrace vibe.\n\n2- The service is pretty good, our host was good about getting us our food and checking in on us. When it came down the suggestions there wasn't too much back and forth but I went there with a group that had been there before and they helped me out.\n\n3- overall the food was delicious, I got the cubano and the yuca fries. The sauces for the yuca fries were pretty delicious and I poured them all over. The cubana was pretty good but not the best one that I've had. I've never had authentic Cuban food so this was definitely a place I enjoyed and would like to try other dishes from.\n\nI'll be back Versailles\nSee all photos from Christopher C. for Versailles Cuban Food",

We ordered two entrees:\n\n* Famoso Pollo Versailles (Versailles Famous Garlic Chicken) with Moros y Cristianos (black beans and rice cooked together) and plantains -- awesome as usual\n\n* Pollo En Salsa Barbacoa (Barbecue Chicken) with rice and plantains -- one our daughter-in-law's favorites\n\nOrdering through Yelp was a breeze.  Order was ready when I arrived.  BTW I like the new compartmentalized take-out containers.\n\nVersailles' dining room is open again, and it was quite busy, as was the take-out.   The outdoor dining pavilion is still open.  Parking in the small shared lot is quite limited\nFamoso Pollo Versailles (take out)\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool 1\n10/26/2021Previous review\nThe Garlic Chicken is still one of my favorite Cuban dishes anywhere -- delicious roasted half chicken marinated in a delicious mojo de ajo (garlic sauce).  Normally, the chicken is garnished with sliced raw onions; I prefer ordering grilled onions.  I also love the Moros y Cristianos (Cuban black beans and rice) side option and the Platanos Maduros (sweet fried plantains).\n\nIt's \"to go\" currently at Versailles -- no indoor dining. The window for ordering and pickup is just to the right of the front door.  I ordered by phone, and pick up went smoothly.  Service was great on the phone and at pick-up.  Very sad to look inside and see the empty dining room, remembering its lively dining environment.\nRead more",

But be patient ~ it will be worth it!\n\nService is always super friendly and attentive. The bread starter is always a nostalgic favorite! But we never go without at least one person ordering the garlic chicken. It's just so, so good! It's a generous portion of chicken, plantains, rice, and Cuban black beans. Make sure every bite of chicken gets sauces and a bite of onion ~ it's AMAZING!!! Definitely a big enough portion to share.\n\nAnytime I go to a Cuban restaurant I order Ropa Vieja & I must say Versailles has one of the best. Shredded beef so tender and flavorful! Also served with plantains, rice, and those delicious black beans it's a dish that should be ordered at least once!\n\nWe also love the Bistec Empanizado (breaded thin steak with the same yummy garlic sauce and side of onions) but skipped it this visit. But also a must-try.\n\nIf you're looking for Cuban food out on the West Side, definitely give Versailles a try! You won't be disappointed!\nUseful 11\nFunny 5\nCool 9\n6/23/2011Previous review\nSOOOO Yummy! Expect a wait, and sometimes parking can be a pain, but so worth it!",

Been awhile since we had Cuban food & this place looked worth the trip. Overall the food & service made for a worthwhile trip.\n\nITEM'S ORDERED:\n\nOxtail Stew\nMedia Noche\n\nTASTE:\n\nThe Oxtail Stew is described as a Creole base stew with a sharp peppery taste cooked with traditional Cuban herbs & spices, olive oil & bell pepper. I actually don't think the peppey taste was that sharp but it was definitely present. For some reason I thought the overall flavor kinda tasted like chili. It's a pretty good portion of oxtail. The plantains that come with the meal were very tasty & sweet. Perhaps they are actually sweetened. Getting a bite of the meat, stew, rice & plantain hits pretty much all the taste buds in a nice way. Oxtail is quite fatty so the stew is on the oily side.\n\nMedia Noche is the usual traditional Cuban sandwich with sweet bread. I usually like this version over the usual Cuban because I think the sweet bread provides a good balance to all the salty flavors. I actually wish the bread was just a little sweeter. Pretty good sandwich overall, big on the savory with all the meat & cheese. I did think the pork was just a little dry. Fries were fresh & crisp. Reminded me of fries you get at \"hole in the wall\" burger spots in a good way. Also is a very nicely sized sandwich. I took half of it home.\n\nAs a fan of spice I did wish the restaurant had a more unique or house made hot sauce or something to go with the food. Only Cholula was available.\n\nSERVICE:\n\nService was very good. The guy at the outside patio seated us right away & had a kind attitude the whole time. Also, the food came out very quickly.\n\nI should mention I thought there was only outside seating but I was wrong since I had to use the restroom inside & saw inside seating is available.\n\nLOCATION & PARKING:\n\nThey are located on Venice Blvd & their sign is easy to spot from the street.\n\nThe outdoor seating area is one of the better built ones I've seen. Good tarps & many tables which still make you feel like you're at a restaurant.\n\nParking is easy enough with all their spot's right out front. I did find them just a little narrow though.\n\nI'm open to coming back here when I'm craving this type of food or just a hearty meal in general.\n\nCheers!\nSee all photos from Jeremy C. for Versailles Cuban Food",

Remember to ask to be seated in the garden area. The aromas while you wait are pretty incredible, the scent of roasted meat begins wafting over to your booth. The music playing in the background has an energetic Afro-Cuban rhythm that urgently tells you something great is about to go down.\n\nFamoso Pollo Versailles (Versailles Famous Garlic Chicken)\nThis dish truly lives up to its name. The plate has half a roast chicken marinated in garlic sauce served with sliced onions. For a few more dollars, you can get all white meat or all dark meat. Versailles is known for super crispy chicken skin, and that first bite is like cracking through a crispy creme brulee shell. The garlic mojo criollo sauce is lively like the music, a mix of vibrant garlic, citrus zing, and oregano. Soon, bits of juicy meat soak up the zesty sauce with bits of crunchy onion. On the side are large golden plantains, chewy and caramelized on the edges. The moros y cristianos are black beans and white rice cooked together in perfect delicious harmony. They also taste great on their own. Guys, this is seriously a lot of food. I'm a pretty capable eater, but I couldn't finish everything.\n\nI'll be back soon to try the roasted pork or the oxtails.\nVersailles Famous Garlic Chicken - half a chicken, all dark meat",

(Busy around 8)\n\n4 of us and we wanted to sample a variety so we went with some appetizers and a couple of entrees.\n\nAppetizers were Yuca Frita & Tostones De Platanos Verdes (green plantation patties).  Both were tasty and we enjoyed the garlic sauce/dip.  \nMains were Ropa Vieja (some Barbacoa similarities and so rich/decadent), 1/2 Garlic Chicken (just the right amount of garlic seasoning on the roasted chicken.)\nWe also ordered their Cuban sandwich for sharing -(some of the best we've had.)\nEnjoyed all of the sides (Avocado salad, rice & black beans) also especially the yellow rice.  \nGenerous portions so we had plenty of leftovers.  \n\nOverall, authentic and pure comfort & looking forward to returning and dining at the restaurant!

I was told that the waiting time here is long during peak hours.\nMy hubby ordered the famous Rabo encendido and it was really good. Very tender and the serving was generous. I ordered the white fish with lemon and garlic and it was also very tasty. Both dishes are served with plantains on the side.  Price is reasonable and service was fast. Parking slots are limited so best to come here at off peak hours. They do have dedicated parking  for pick up orders.

They have plenty of patio seating, but they also are now allowing dine in.  All employees are wearing face masks and gloves.\n\nOur waiter was the best! So attentive and friendly! (We're the girls with the cupcakes ) thank you!\n\nWe ordered the famous garlic chicken and the oxtails! Amazing! The garlic bread they provide is fresh! Their sangria is delicious and plentiful and gets you nice and feeling happy. The garlic chicken is crispy and tangy garlic flavor with their wonderful fluffy buttered rice, sooo good!! First time trying the oxtails, and WOW , so delicious! Plenty of stew served with their rice and plantains. So good I may be back before the weekend is over!\n\nPlenty of food, portion size is great and you still can't beat the price! Wonderful!",

I've been coming to this location for as long as I can remember and I never get sick of the Famous Chicken!\n\nParking might be a little tight but you manage to make it work. The stalls in the front of the restaurant are super tight but there are more on the side lot. There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and the service is super friendly.\n\nI always order the Famoso Pollo Versailles - Versailles Famous Garlic Chicken. Everything from the chicken, to the garlic sauce, to the onions, to the beans....it's basically heaven on earth. I am usually not a fan of chicken breast because it can get a little dry, but soak it in the garlic/lemon sauce that's at the bottom and bamn! Delicious! Personally, I didn't like to eat onions like that until I came here. Made me love onions. The rice that comes with everything is fantastic too. Not too watery/dry. Also, some of my folks don't like the fried bananas that come with it but I love it! Makes for a great side dish to compliment the chicken.\n\nIf you're thinking about coming here or not, don't think...just go.\nTo go order of their famous garlic chicken",

                  "review": "3 photos\nVersailles is the perfect Cuban restaurant for those in the LA area who are very familiar with Cuban food and those who have never tried Cuban food before (prepare to fall in love with Cuban cuisine). I would say that I am pretty familiar with Cuban food, having been to Cuba and Miami's famous calle ocho, and I would go to bat to say Versailles has food most reminiscent to those experiences (pretty authentic). I have tried a handful of Cuban restaurants in the greater LA area and Versailles each time takes the cake, even with their various flaws.\n\nFor those who have never been here before, I can tell you that you should choose your entree carefully, I usually stick with the tried and true dishes. The dishes that I find to be my favorites are: Vaca Frita, Bistec de Pollo, Lechon, Oxtail Soup and Ropa Vieja. I have to be completely honest here, I have ventured away from these dishes before, and I was mildly disappointed, particularly with some of the appetizers. They weren't terrible, but there are certain options here that are stellar, and some that aren't. And that's the biggest pitfall of this place- consistency. Although it is rare that one of my favorite dishes comes out not as well as usual, it has happened and I feel bad for those who come for the first time and experience that. Fortunately I am aware of this and can pardon it.\n\nI would also recommend the Mojitos here; they are some of the best outside of Miami and are even authentically served with sugar cane and mint leaves.\n\nDespite the serious consistency issue (caused IMO by the fact that they have let it get to them that they've become one of the most popular Cuban spots in LA), I keep coming here because they do Cuban food better than the majority of Cuban restaurants in the Greater LA area (even with their off-days). The service is not fantastic, the parking is annoying, but their signature dishes are hard to find and top notch- which is why I will keep coming here for many more years.",

After spending a couple of hours waiting at a restaurant that never ended up taking us, my parents decided we should go to Versailles instead. And oh am I glad they did! The food was delicious and I've been to the restaurant many times since then.\n\nEvery time I've been, Versailles has gotten us a table in less than 20 minutes. The waiters are always very nice and judgment-free when literally everyone at the table orders the garlic chicken because it is so so so good! The portion size is HUGE, the flavor is very unique, and the meal also comes with plantains (the best plantains I've ever had), rice, and beans -- as well as complimentary bread before your meal is served.\n\nMy only complaint is that I wish the prices were just a little bit lower. Other than that, I love this place!",

So I've been meaning to check out Versailles so that hopefully I have a place to satisfy the occasional Cuban food cravings.\n\nI went with my sister (other best judge of Cuban food I know) and we ordered the arroz con pollo (chicken and yellow rice) and the lechon asado (roasted pork). We also got croquetas as an appetizer because that's one of the only ways you'll know if they're legit.\n\nThe croquetas were fine. They'll get the job done if you've got a hankering for them and don't have $300 for a plane ticket or in my case can't get mom to mail you some. The arroz con pollo was pretty good but could've had a tad bit more flavor. The lechon was also good but maybe a little too on the citrusy side for my taste.\n\nOverall though they do a pretty good job and I'll be stopping by again whenever I need a quick Cuban bite!\nArroz con pollo with lechon in the background",

Crowded yes. But found a parking place and a table as soon as we needed one, yea!\nThere are plenty of choices on the menu, this is very similar to mexican style food without the wraps or jalape\u00f1os. The meats slow cooked, served with black beans and rice. I enjoyed pulled pork, P had the roasted chicken and mom enjoyed the steak sandwich. My meal was washed down with a mango shake, our tasty apps included wings, B.b. soup, yuca fries, and platanos.\nWe finished up with arroz con leche rice pudding and tres leches cake. Bottom line great place! Luis was a fantastic, happy, and a fast waiter. We never waited for him.\nThe place was packed and loud but it was a great environment, fun.\nSlightly Americanized over the last 30 years yet it still has the touches of a place in Havana, cool old school bar stools.\nCome on in and give it a try, not a weekly place for me but certainly one to go to when your tired of the usual.\nfoodguy-Martin\nIt all looks good, we'll see.",

Ordered take out last night as opposed to eating in and it was still just as good.\n\nMy go to dish is always the garlic chicken. The garlic sauce is like crack. I always ask for extra sauce so I can mix my rice and even the plantains in it. Oh yeah, the fried plantains are amazing!\n\nI also love how they give you such big portions. The garlic chicken is literally like half a chicken. I can never eat it in one sitting so I always have leftovers the next day which is awesome. They give you a big portion of rice and lots of plantains.\n\nIf you're looking for a good appetizer, try the beef empanadas or the tamales. They use the garlic crack sauce on the tamales as well.\n\nWhen I do eat in, the service is always on point. Friendly and attentive.",

                  "review": "Versailles is one of those places in LA that you just HAVE to go to.  It's a cuban restaurant located on Venice Blvd and it's really unassuming.  The outside an inside decor is obviously cuban themed.  I found it fun, festive and authentic.\nWe were seated right away but a waiter and the service the entire night was friendly, fast and quiet.  The table next to us was a loud spanish speaking group that was drinking wine and enjoying the food and I found myself peaking over at their food and drinks a lot to make sure I ordered the same thing!\n\nThe bread that came out before the meal was incredibly soft and tastey~~ probably b/c of the butter. =P  But I seriously love bread that has a soft inside and kind of tougher chewy outside.  It's the perfect kind of bread to dip into sauces.  Know what I mean??\n\nSo every meal comes with rice, black beans, and fried plantains.  SERIOUSLY...so freaking delicious.  I can't go over these three staples in brazilian food, cuban food and most recently, ghanian food!\n\nDish #1: OX TAIL!!  OMG the meat literally fell off the bone and it was so tender and juicy.\n\nDish #2: Pork!!  I totally thought this would come out in pork chop form but it came out more like shredded pork.  It was still amazing and I couldn't get over the marinated onions!!  YUMMMM\n\nDish #3: Chicken!  This was what I knew Versailles for and what everyone on yelp recommended.  I think the boys I went with were intimidated to break apart the chicken but that's my favorite part!!  So I shredded it for the table and enjoyed every bite with a little bite of rice, black beans, and onions.  YUMMMMM\n\nI also used the bread to soak up the sauces from each of the plates.\n\nIf you've never been to versailles, I totally recommend this place.  Make not that this is NOT mexican food and the flavors will be different (you don't know how many people I know who've made that mistake).  Parking can kind of be a pain if you go during a busy time but there's always free street parking after 7 or 8!",

I want to like this place, but it's really unspecial.\n\nTheir cubano (signature dish!) needed more pickles and more mustard... it was pretty flavorless.  They also really didn't grill the bun at all, so it wasn't crisp like a good cubano should be.\n\nAll in all, I left here pretty disappointed.  Other tables had some decent looking plantains and black beans, but whatever -- if a Cuban diner can't nail a cubano, what's the point, right?",

I did the quarter chicken special and really enjoyed it. Crispy flavorful skin and a moist center makes for some pretty damn good chicken. The garlic sauce that sits at the bottom of the plate is amazing. I make sure to dip every bite of chicken and plantains in the sauce.\n\nThis past visit I also tried the shredded pork special which was definitely very flavorful but nothing like the chicken special. The service was great and man, even with a packed restaurant, they are always so fast.\n\nI'll be back soon.",

I have to say we went in pretty much knowing we were going to try a Cubano sandwich, so we ordered that and a side of plantains. Our waiter was friendly and timely with good suggestions and was attentive. The sandwich was very tasty and the bread was out of this world. I am slightly disappointed that the ham that was on the sandwich was not thicker sliced ham, but overall it was still a very tasty sandwich. We also had the plantains and they were perfect! They were perfectly crispy all the way around with soft middles - just like I like them.\nI would definitely give this place another try and the next time I think we will go with a different dish. The place had a real homie feel and we were sat almost immediately. We will be back soon!",

Best chicken of his life? Really? How good can roast chicken possibly be.\n\nOn one of my bff's visits, we decided to finally make it here. We were greeted happily and seated in the colorful dining room. They gave us menus and a basket of awesome garlic bread. It reminded me of this garlic bread my mom and I used to make with lawry's garlic spread (basically butter, garlic, and lots of salt. We ordered ham croquettes, garlic chicken, and a grilled porkchop.\n\nThe ham croquettes were shaped like chubby mozzarella sticks. They were crispy with a smooth and salty ham filling. Then the entrees came. I can never resist plantains and they were excellent. It also came with the traditional black beans and rice. The pork chop was vinegary and flavorful. My ex-bf's brother was right. The garlic chicken was perfection. It was super juicy and had a crisp garlicky skin that tasted like a huge garlic potato chip.\n\nI'm sure everything else on the menu is just as good. I can also see it getting old if you go there too often because it all does boil down to meat, plantain, beans, and rice. The chicken here is definitely worth a visit though.",

There were a couple of things I had ordered in the past that has delicious, and others, not too crazy about.  Parking is always a nightmare during peak dinner hours, the waiters seems too busy to see if you need a beverage refill, and when you call in your order, its the most frustrating experience.\n\nCuban dishes are enriched with garlic and onions. I'm Korean, so I'm not shy from garlic, but some of the dishes I had ordered from Versailles, had way too much garlic. Here is a brief run down of the dishes I ordered in the past:\n\nPollo Asado Garlic Half Chicken ($12.99)\nCONS: Flavor FULL of garlic. I think it was too much garlic; Chicken was overcooked. DRY\nPROS: Portions were huge! Half chicken, with rice, beans, and platanos.\n\nPaella Estilo ($26.99)\nCONS: Again, TOO MUCH GARLIC; Seafood seemed slightly overcooked; Rice was under cooked\nPROS: Portions were huge!\n\nArroz Con Pollo ($11.99)\nCON: They should serve half chicken on this dish. Portions seemed small in comparison to other entrees.\nPROS: My favorite dish at Versailles; Chicken was cooked PERFECTLY; They eased up on the garlic (but they plated the dish with alot of onions)\n\nTres Leches Cake ($5.99)\nCON: Pretty pricey for one slice!\nPROS: The most expensive slice of tres leches cake I've had so far, but worth EVERY penny; The cake was soaked but it wasn't soggy to the point that it was mush. The cake was perfectly moist! I love how even their slices are generous in portion.\n\nAgain, I wish I had better experiences at Versailles, but this restaurant felt like it was all hype to me.",

This is our absolute number one go-to place to take out of towners... and it doesn't hurt that its so close to our apartment.\n\nThe garlic chicken is great, but my absolute favorite dish is the Lengua. It is cooked the same way we have Lengua in my hometown.\n\nThe food is pretty consistent so you won't go wrong with this place.\n\nThe last time we took some people to this place was a month ago - and my friends were from Singapore and regularly visited Thailand and other asian places. I sure wasn't going to take them to a Thai restaurant, even though you can't go wrong with the cuisine. Needless to say, I've had them raving about the meal afterwards - my out-of-towner friend actually lived in Miami for a while a few years back and he said Versailles is more or less authentic Cuban.\n\nThe best thing is that it's cheap! Yes, the food can feel a little heavy and the portions gigantic - so share the dishes if possible, and get take-out boxes afterwards too.\n\nParking tip: this branch of Versailles has ample parking, but the La Cienega one has mostly street parking.",

I hadn't really had too much Cuban food before so I was dying to try this place while out with my good friend Elizabeth and my fab sister.\n\nThis place is known around LA and other parts for its Cuban food, so you could imagination my anticipation.\n\nParking was no biggie-they have a lot. We walked in at dinner time on a Sunday and were seated immediately and served fresh bread with garlic butter.\n\nI ordered the pork dish. My friend got the pork and chicken combo. We also go the the wing appetizer with the cilantro cream dipping sauce.\n\nEverything was superb. Out of the chicken and the pork, my friend absolutely recommended the pork, even though she said the chicken was delicious, as well.\n\nThe pork was tender and marinated in some sort of citrus. It was devoured.\n\nChicken wings were awesome! I loved 'em. All of them were gone within a matter of minutes. They were crunchy, flavorful and the sauce was a big YES!\n\nDefinitely worth a go ;-)\n\nThank me later.",

U would think they make the best mojito...sadly they don't. If you want a very good mojito then go to \"The Abbey\" in west Hollywood.  I ordered their Ropa Vieja and it wasn't good. I do like their Famoso Pollo (chicken). My husband orders the combination of Famoso Pollo and Lechon Asado (pork).",

It was the place where I first experienced Cuban food.\n\nI've tried the shredded beef, I've tried the Arroz con Pollo, I've tried a couple of other things I can't remember the names of, but I always, always, always come back to either the 6 (Famoso Pollo Versailles - Versailles Famous Garlic Chicken), or the 7a (Bistec De Pollo - Chicken Steak).\n\nI love the savory but citrusy marinade of the chicken, I love the contrasting sweetness of the plantains, I love the smooth savory goodness of the black beans, and I love the brothy richness of the rice. It's a meal that never fails to gratify.\n\nGo for the 6 if you want the chicken with bones and skin - you get a half chicken, breast, leg, wing, thigh and overall it's juicier than than the 7a.\n\nIf you're in a bit of healthy mood, do the 7a for a boneless skinless grilled chicken breast - less juicy, but still excellent. The 7 is the same thing but breaded and friend, and I've never been a fan. If I want fattier, I go for the 6.\n\nThey also have a good dulce de leche cake for dessert if you're up for it.",

We ordered the flattened chicken that came with grilled onions and garlic sauce. (The onions were the star of this dish tbh lol). The garlic sauce tasted more like lemon sauce. It was super sour. I felt that zankou chickens garlic sauce was far more superior. I subbed a salad for the beans, plantains, and rice and I think that was a good idea. The best part of the meal was the fried yucca that we shared. It was fried to a crisp and deliciously steaming. The servers were plenty and they checked on us frequently but we didn't feel they were friendly. My friend was so disappointed and kept repeating that the food is not what it used to be...probably won't return or recommend going forward.",

Their garlic mojo criollo sauce is so good!!! Don't underestimate their beans, too. Nothing like what you get at some Mexican restaurants. I'm not a big fan of plantains but it comes with the food.\n\nI also got their tres leches cake and cuban coffee. Perfect pair to finish your meal :)\n\nOh, just one more thing - for some reason, the quality of food at Manhattan Beach location is not as good as the one here on Venice Blvd. If you can afford to travel a little longer distance, I'd definitely recommend the Culver City one!",

When we got there, you wait in a line outside the restaurant and they give you tables on a first come, first serve basis.  We ended up waiting 20 minutes, but it wasn't that long compared to a line at Cheesecake factory on a similar night (2 hours!)  My group of 4 started with a pitcher of sangria, which really hit the spot after a grueling work week.  I ordered the plate No. 1 Lechon Asado (Cuban style roast pork) and it was so gooooodddd.  The pork was juicy and I loved the garlic mojo sauce!  I also really like fried sweet plantains and I ate up all of them on the plate.  It was so much food and well worth the price ($10).  Next time I want to try the calamari steak, which my friend highly recommended.  Yum!!!\n\n// Updated 6/30/2008\n\nI tried the calamari steak and it was very buttery and rich.  I still prefer the No. 1 Lechon Asado!",

We're only a drive away from Santa Monica, a jump away from West LA, a skip away from Century City, and stones throw from Culver City. As a result, I've had the experience to dine at many scrumptious restaurants, restaurants I'll miss dearly when I eventually move.\n\nOne such restaurant is Versailles, where I've been frequenting for years. I've never had a bad meal at Versailles. The service is always quick, the workers are always friendly, and most importantly, the food is always delicious. As a bonus, the plates are huge, usually big enough for two meals for me.\n\nI've tried many dishes: the garlic chicken (its true what they say: they put crack in the sauce), shrimp in garlic sauce, streak strip, shredded beef, grilled pork chop... BUT for the past year or so, I've ONLY ordered the oxtail stew. The sauce... the tenderness... add a couple splashes of Tapatio sauce, there's nothing better!",

Personally I think the garlic chicken can be a little dry but is still extremely tasty. I love the fact that it is served with yummy plantains (fried bananas). I also like the fact that the portion is huge and I always have leftovers for the next days lunch.\n\nParking can sometimes be an issue over here on a weekend at the prime dinner time but you usually find parking on the street.",

                  "review": "I was hungry.\n\nThe BF must feel as if I'm getting fat, because he suggested that we WALK somewhere for dinner.\n\n\"WALK?!\" I asked, incredulous.  \"In the dark?!  We'll get mugged!\"\n\nHis response was pretty much, \"We can go to Versailles.  It's just across the street.\"\n\nTrue.  But I didn't like the idea of walking the dark streets - nope, didn't like it one bit.\n\nHe pretended to be deaf to my protests, and soon enough, hunger won out over fears of being mugged on the cold streets of LA.  We crossed Venice, stepped into Versailles, and I let out a sigh of relief.  We made it in one piece.\n\nThe restaurant itself brought comfort, too.  After all, it was brightly lit, surprisingly spacious, and bustling with customers.  We were seated quickly, a two-top towards the back of the room.  The decor wasn't all that special, but it was homey enough.\n\nWe were given our massive menus and left alone to peruse them at peace.  I opened it up and...\n\nIt's an indecisive person's WORST NIGHTMARE.  No joke, there are probably over a hundred menu items listed.  It took me at least ten minutes to get through the menu because I kept forgetting what I'd seen on previous pages.\n\nMeanwhile, we were served some warm buttery bread.  Muy delicioso!  Crumbs flying everywhere, I continued to thumb through the menu, discussing possible options with the BF.\n\nFinally, finally, I narrowed down my choices and... we were ready to order.\n\nExcept...\n\nExcept...\n\nExcept...\n\nHello?  Where's our server?\n\nIt seemed as if servers were whisking by EVERY TABLE but ours.  And in fact, we hadn't even been served our waters.  After absentmindedly chowing down on piece after piece of buttery bread, I was THIRSTY, yo!\n\nNo water, no server, no food.  What the heck?\n\nFinally, we managed to flag down our waitress and we placed our drink and food orders.\n\nA million light years go by, and still no drinks.\n\nThe BF is a patient guy on most days.  However, even he was getting antsy and annoyed with the service.  Strangely enough, it was ME telling HIM to chill out.  Twilight Zone status.\n\nAfter what seemed like another few million light years, our drinks and food came out and...\n\nI got some sort of chicken with lemon sauce, white rice, onions, fries, and plantains.  I opted for no beans.  No me gusta beans.\n\nI don't remember what the BF ordered.\n\nAnyway, MY DISH was not... pleasing to my taste buds.\n\nThe chicken was fine, nice and juicy and all, but... the sauce had to go home.  It was overly citrusy, to the point where it tasted like a sort of lemon vinaigrette salad dressing.  Pretty much, I thought it was way too sour (I could literally feel my taste buds puckering with each bite).\n\nI didn't want the food to go to waste, so I had to do what I could to salvage it.  I asked for some hot sauce.  After slathering my chicken with Tapatio, it became more palatable.\n\nReally, it wasn't the food itself.  It was the sauce.  I'm not keen AT ALL on that sauce.  I kept mentioning how it tasted like sour salad dressing...\n\nAnd sure enough...\n\nOn our way out...\n\nI saw bottles of \"sauce\" on the counter by the cashier.  It was some sort of Cuban lemon sauce... \"perfect for beef, chicken, pork, seafood, and salad!\"  OMG it WAS salad dressing!!!  How can ONE sauce compliment pretty much EVERYTHING?!\n\nMaybe it's a Cuban thing and my tongue is just too uncultured to appreciate it all.\n\nWhatever the case, I've decided that this Cuban lemon sauce is totally not my thing.\n\nNow, if the service had been better (or even somewhat EXISTENT), I might not have felt so dissatisfied with the whole experience.\n\nToo bad the service was even worse than the  lemon sauce.",

Perhaps it was the way it was lightly cooked and gently placed on top of the chicken and rice. It just fit perfectly with their Roasted Garlic Chicken dish I've ordered, and everything was delicious at every bite. It's a great deal, with it being only $8.99 for lunch, and it comes with white rice, black beans, and fries.  \n\nMy only complaint was the portion of the chicken. I get that it's a lunch special, so the portions should be smaller, but not one-chicken-leg-and-wing small.  The chicken was tiny and I was sad and sad filling up the rest of my stomach with much rice and beans. I loved the garlic-y flavor though.",

                  "review": "Okay, so I've been a frequent Versailles visitor since I was introduced to it is a kid in my middle school days.  Every now and again when I, my friends, or visiting family members have a taste for exquisite ox tails, intensely flavored and tender garlic chicken, or cuban black beans with rice and sweet, sweet plantains, Versailles is the obvious choice.  I definitely prefer the one on Venice Boulevard, probably because it is the one I've most frequented due to circumstance.\n\nNonetheless, all of the Versailles establishments are phenomenal.  I'm a huge fan of all foods ethnic, and this place takes the cake in the realm of Cuban fare.  No one I've ever been with at Versailles has ever disliked their meal and there are always plenty of leftovers to take home, which is just dandy!\n\nNow, here's a funny little story about one of my visits to Versailles.  My sister and I were invited by my cousin to attend a birthday celebration on behalf of one of her friends.  Since both of us love Versailles, it was an obvious yes.  My sister being the proactive leader that she is decided to attempt a reservation to accommadate our fairly large party.  She first called the Versailles on Venice and the dialogue went as follows:\n\nCourtney: Hi, do you take reservations?\n\nVersailles Guy: No, so sorry.\n\nCourtney:  Well okay, how long would you say the wait is for about 10 people at 7pm?\n\nVersailles Guy:  Ooooh, 7pm.  Very, very crowded time at 7pm.  Long, long wait for you and your friends.\n\nCourtney:  Oh really?  Gosh, how long would you say the wait is then?\n\nVersailles Guy:  Ohhhhhh, teeeen minutes!\n\nCourtney:  Ten minutes?!\n\nVersailles Guy:  Yes, teeeen minutes!\n\nCourtney (Thinking in her head):  This guy seems a little off, let me try the one on La Cienga.\n\nShe calls.\n\nCourtney:  Hi, do you take reservations?\n\nVersailles Guy #2: No, so sorry.\n\nCourtney:  How long would you say the wait is then around 7pm?\n\nVersailles Guy #2:  Ooooh, long, long wait.  Long time.\n\nCourtney:  Well, how long is that?\n\nVersailles Guy #2:  Uhhhhh, teeen minutes,\n\nWhen my sister re-hashed that story in the workers' accent, we were all dying of laughter since they clearly made it seem that our hopes for a seat or short wait was impossible at the 7pm hour on a Friday night.  \"Teeeeen minutes\" though, is not so bad in my book! ;  )",

I ordered the famous chicken which was dry and had a sour, vinegar like flavor. The best thing I had were the black beans. Pretty darn good and really flavorful. I will not be coming back!",

I do not know if its what we ordered, but this place SUCKS!!!\n\nMy dad ordered #6 (the half chicken) and I ordered #1 (pork).  Our food came out faster then a McDonald's Drive-thru!  \n\nAside from that, our food was just straight lemon juice and a pound of salt, oh and to top it off with some raw onion slices.  I could make this sh*t at home.  No wonder America is freaking #1 in obesity, diabetes, and high/low blood pressure.  \n\nMaybe I'll come back for their tamales, but that's it!!!",

Oxtails taste just like home, but the sauce is a bit on the weak side- needs some more seasoning but still tasty over all. Good portions, good value.

It was good and moist but I didn't think it was the best chicken. The flavors were a bit overpowering for me. I think it was lemon but it says it's garlic chicken. Our waiter was a nice guy but he could have been more attentive. It took a while for him to get us a refill. I had to sip on ice cubes for a while until he finally asked if we needed a refill. I would have also not liked my plantains sitting in the chicken juice, plus I only got two on my dish :(. They weren't sweet and they tasted like the lemon flavor of the chicken. I love when they give bread as a starter but this was a bit over buttered. It's a nice place overall but it wouldn't be my first choice for Cuban food.",

Lemony tang from the sauce, crispy chicken skin topped with sliced onions. It comes with plantains cooked to perfection, rice, and the tastiest black beans I've ever had.\nSampler platter had a pork tamale, chicken wings and variations of croquettes and yucca galore but the sauce got everything a little soggy. It was one of the craziest sampler plates I've witnessed.\nCuban sandwich was pressed with melted cheese, ham and pickles served with French fries. Very tasty.\nThe side salad was not stunning by any means, chopped veggies and dressing on the side, an unnecessary buy.. hardly touched the thing. More sliced onions.\nTry the Yerba Mate soda tastes kinds of like apple soda and is the champagne of colas.\nThe food was great and the waiters were very attentive, seriously great service.

I still get the chicken with yellow rice ($11.99--prices have gone up but quality seems more consistent as a result), with the chicken cooked to the point that it basically falls off the bone without being dry. The rice is very flavorful and wonderful, and if you like plantains, they are a perfect mix of sweet and sour. The garlic chicken (or other meat) seems better than I remember; before it was so lemony that I couldn't touch it without puckering. But, now it seems quite good, mixed with very fresh (aka potent) slices of white onion. To tone down the flavor a bit, I would encourage you to go for the pork rather than chicken, or perhaps get the combo and try both ($13.99). The mango and guanabana smoothies are a bit pricier than I recall, now a little bit steep at $3.99, and are rather dilute and weak in flavor. If you want to try something new and richer, go for the mamey. Overall, aside from parking, which can be tight if you are able to get a spot and the high volume of conversation inside, it is a good place with good food in good portions. I will likely be back another time for dinner and perhaps for happy hour, for I noticed they have $3 mojitos from 6-8pm!!",

Other cuban restaurants with way better flavor in Los Angeles have now convinced me that versailles is just average, maybe below.  I will give this place another try in the near future; maybe it was just that day their  $16.00 ropa vieja tasted like blah.",

What makes it great is not just the flavor, but the texture of the chicken. It is smooth, moist and just falls off the bone. Delicious.

Everything was fine when we were seated but then it was crap from there. We placed our order including drinks. We ended up getting our food before the drinks so we asked for them again. It was just a Coke and a water, nothing difficult. However, we had to ask twice for the drinks. A little aggravating. Then the side of rice was cold. Not lukewarm, straight from the fridge cold. Clearly we ask for a replacement. The first waiter acts like he doesn't understand the request. He gets another guy  to come and figure out what the problem is. My boyfriend has to tell him in Spanish what the deal is. OK, I'm sorry, how hard is it to figure out that the rice is cold and we want another? Really? From then on the service was terrible. We ate to the sound of the bored waitstaff (it was slow) cursing in Spanish the entire time and then having the waitress practically chuck the check at us. No one came by to check if we needed drink refills, they took condiments off our table while we sitting there and in general it was an altogether rude and unpleasant dining experience from the multiple people that served us (was everyone taking a turn?)\n\nNow, I still like the food but for shitty service like this and for the price (which isn't exactly dirt cheap), it's not worth the trouble. Step up Versailles, you're not that awesome that we can't go somewhere more pleasant for Cuban food.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n3/7/2009Previous review\nI'm not too familiar with Cuban food (I've only had it once before) so I'm not judging authenticity or anything. I'm judging solely on taste.\n\nNote the fact that the parking lot is almost always full at all hours. This says something don't you think? That many people can't be wrong? I'm lucky and I live only a block away so I walked. The poor sign could use some fixing but hey isn't it what's inside that counts right?\n\nInside? Let's just say I wouldn't come here for the ambiance. It was pretty crowded and loud and certainly not fancy. Ok whatever, we all know why everyone is REALLY here and it's not to stalk celebrities or  to enjoy the mood lighting.\n\nThe food: It is rich, filling, and really bursting with flavor. I had the Ropa Vieja beef dish which was a heaping pile of tender juicy succulent meat cooked in a great sauce. The rice was nice and fluffy and the plantains. OH GOD THE PLANTAINS. I've never been a huge fan of anything from the banana family but damn did those deep fried little suckers taste SO GOOD. I did get to try the infamous garlic chicken as well. It is as good as everyone says. It wasn't very garlic-y this time but had so much deep flavor with a hint of something citrus. It penetrates into the whole piece of chicken but the SKIN. Ok I know it's gross but I had almost all the skin off that thing. SO GOOD. Crispy, melt-in-your-mouth, citrus-y, garlic scented goodness. If I could have, I would have ordered a plate of garlic chicken skin. YUM.\nI also had a mojito which wasn't spectacular but what did make it stand out was that it was served with a piece of real sugar cane inside. Awesome and unique.",

Spice and me ... well, we don't agree... in fact my tummy fights it all the way and for my trouble I get tummy aches... But I was told it's good so I tried it.  \n\nWell, it was delicious and lightly flavored just the way I like it.  The chicken was really moist and juicy, the saffron rice with pimentos - divine,... and reminded me of Spanish rice because of the flavor, but the colors were more vibrant.  The beans were delicious.  And I just loved the fried plantains... I gobbled those up so fast.  Yummy... and the price for the quantity of food, I would say makes this a great deal!  I guess they are known for their chicken and onions... And it was delicious.\n\nIt was a very busy restaurant but we were seated right away and the waiter came back with our order quickly.  I didn't expect it to come so fast but it did.  I recommend this place!!",

For about $13 bucks with tip, you'll come way with their garlic chicken with rice, beans, and plantains with a diet coke.  You can't go wrong with it.  Service is really fast; I wouldn't take someone out on a first date here as the ambiance is loud and a bit hectic, but if you are looking for good food that's cheap and fast, you need to come here.",

The food is traditional Cuban, but many of the items are just too exotic for me.  Whenever I go, I stick to one of their low numbered specials (7, 7a, 8, etc.).

I couldn't wait to get to the car, not to speak of back home.  Good thing I didn't wait, because I went right back inside to get another one.  You will want two.  Trust me on this.\n\nYou will never eat another \"danish\" after having the real thing served up by the incredibly cheerful folks from Denmark who own and run this adorable, immaculate, cheerful little bakery.\n\nEverything I've tried has been wonderful, but the Kringle is my favorite.  It's super flaky, a little sweet, with a kiss of almond inside.  I don't care for some of the items with huge amounts of marzipan inside, like the Napoleon hat, but the Kringle has the perfect balance.  First runner up:  the cinnamon braid. It's a little more tender (less flaky) than the others, but is somehow perfect.  Don't forget to try some of the non-sweet bread items they sell there. Coffee is available, but it's pretty weak.  \n\nI'd kind of like to linger in the environment and savor my treats, but there's no seating here, save for a bench outside.   There's a little awkward parking lot next to the place, and street parking is usually easy to find.",

However, we all agree- how did this pastry shop get five, let me repeat, five stars from 799 people who reviewed it. Not four and a half, but five. I have a friend who is in data analytics, and he thinks it's probably rigged. This really made me think about Yelp and it's reviews.

When I finally got there, I made a HUGE order. Their pastry is really flakey and tasty. I have to say that the cinnamon ones are not very good, but otherwise everything else was so tasty and I love the fact that they aren't too sweet. Romkugle was really really dense and chocolate-y. I especially love anything with their yellow custards. So Copenhagen and diamond would be my favorites. They ran out of nougat crown when I went but that one looks so delicious! I have to go back and try it!",

The pastries are so flaky, light and flavor filled and made on site so they are never old just fresh and tasty!  \n\nLOL As much as I LOVE this place I think I freak the employees out every time I go!  I come in all loud and excited like a 10 year old fat kid who just got his allowance, yelling, laughing and pointing at every thing saying \"oooh what is that, what is that, I want that, and that, and that!\" and they just look at me with smiles kinda laughing, yet with a look that says \"please don't freak out our other customers\" lol.

It had a very strong almond taste (which I really liked).\n\nWe were disappointed that they didn't have cheese danishes, but the vanilla custard pastries made up for that. The vanilla custard has a very mild flavor.\n\nI will be coming back again... And again... And again...\n\nAlso, I believe they leave out samples for you to try!\nRaspberry macaroon, chocolate, cinnamon, forgot what the last one was called (vanilla custard in the middle)",

Nice flakey, buttery, sweet taste without being overwhelming at all. The Kringle was definitely my favorite! Around $2 for a pastry! The cold brew coffee is also cheap at around $3 and very refreshing and not too sweet. Definitely would come back again!\n\nService: If you happen to come by when the owner is there, you are in good hands! She is beyond generous with her samples and is very sweet.\n\nAmbience: Small little shop, but unfortunately has no tables for seating. It'd be a perfect study spot if it did. Small little bench outside and a parking lot which is a plus!\nKringle pastry- so so good!",

It and their Copenhagen pastry are where it's at! The diamond is great too. I do wish the chocolate one had more custard and more chocolate, but it gets the job done very well. They are light and you can easily have two in one sitting.\n\nThe best Copenhagen style pastry I ever had was in Copenhagen. I cannot say the ones here are as good, (the one there was life changing) but I will say they are in a similar ball park and likely the closest you'll find outside of Copenhagen. You can order ahead online too and they have a convenient little parking lot just to the left of their storefront. I'll definitely be grabbing more of these on future trips back to LA.\nCopenhagen Pastry",

The pastry has nice flake and texture with the right amount of cream. We loved everything we tried: Poppy twist, Chocolate, Napoleon Hat, Copenhagen, Kringle, Nougat Crown. My favorite is the Nougat crown because it has three different fillings in the pastry. Next would be the Napoleon hat; a dense dessert with almond paste and dipped in dark chocolate. Then we have the Kringle, a thinner pastry filled with almond paste and custard, and the Napoleon, thin too but with only custard filling.\n\nThe bakery itself is small with no sitting room. There are little toys and books on display. The staff were very nice and welcoming. They do sell coffee and tea to go with the sweet delights! You can park in their small lot or on the street in front. You can order online for pickup.\n\nMy only complaint about this place is that they need to be closer to me!\nStarting from top going clockwise: Poppy Twist, Kringle, Chocolate, Napoleon Hat, Nougat Brown",

                  "review": "10 photos\nCopenhagen is the capital of Denmark and Copenhagen Pastry is the capital of authentic Danish pastries in Culver City.\n\nShakespeare had it wrong in Hamlet because \"something is scrumptious in the state of Denmark\" and it's the Danish Pastries. Americans have taken the word \"Danish\" to mean almost any strudel or pastry with fruit or filling, but the truth is that many traditional Danish Pastries are light and flaky without any hint of fillings like cheese.\n\nSmall and simple Copenhagen Bakery bakes fresh traditional pastries that puts all those tourist places in Solvang to shame. According to the lady behind the counter, the secret is in the featherweight laminated pastry dough that is rested, rolled, and folded more times than a Croissant and contains eggs, water, and cream instead of milk.\n\nHere's the delicious Danish discoveries I've tried so far:\n\n$2.25 Small Cakes\n* Coconut Top (Coconut & Chocolate) - 5/5\n* Napolean Hat (Cookie Dough, Almond Paste, & Chocolate) - 3/5\n* Kranse (Dark Chocolate & Almond Paste) - 5/5\n\n$1.50 Morning Pastries\n* Poppy Twist (Remonce, Poppy Seeds, & Sesame Seeds) - 5/5\n\n$1.85 Pastries and Spandauer\n* Kringle (Almond Paste, Custard, & Sugar) - 5/5 stars\n* Copenhagen (Custard & Remonce - creamed butter & sugar) - 4.5/5\n* Apple Pastry (Almond Paste & Apples) - 5/5\n* Raspberry Pastry (Raspberry, Custard, & Almond Paste) - 4/5\n\nThere are a few free samples by the register, so, try these if you aren't quite sure. You'd be silly to pass on the sweet Kranse or charming Kringle.\n\nParking is available on the street or in a small lot to the side of the building.\n\nShakespeare isn't the only famous writer I'm disagreeing with after trying Copenhagen Pastry. Danish existentialist Kiekegaard once said that \"Once you label me, you negate me,\" but I'm doing just the opposite ... by labeling Copenhagen Pastry a simple and fabulous 5-star bakery.\n\nSomething is scrumptious in the state of Denmark and you can find it at Copenhagen Pastry in Culver City.\nSee all photos from Michael S. for Copenhagen Pastry",

Granted the inside of the store is quiet small, there is not much space in there to adhere to the 6m apart guidelines to curb COVID-19. There was a family in there today with kids jumping around and a father who was totally oblivious to anyone around him. Definitely felt an eerie presence in there. Or maybe it was just that white family making me feel incredibly uncomfortable as they kept staring at me because I was not white, while they took approximately 20 minutes to order, and pay as their kids went back and forth jumping around the store deciding what pastries they wanted? Racial tension because of BLM? Probably. There were three staff members behind the counter periodically who said nothing, and it took over 20min for one of the girls to serve me. This is not my first time at this bakery and as always Great butter cake pastry only, everything else is meh but mediocre unwelcoming service. Or maybe I'm just not white Danish enough? Definitely won't support them again.",

Today I walked there and back, a 3 mile round trip from my place.\n\nIt's a bummer they don't have any seating here. It would be an awesome spot to actually sit down and have coffee and a pastry. Because there is nowhere to sit, I opted for a pastry sans coffee :-/.\n\nI tried the Kringle as everyone recommends. I will say although it was good, it wasn't as great as what I was expecting. I have had better almond paste pastries in LA (like Bread Bar's almond croissant for example). I really think it's just 3 stars on the food. I also sampled the Copenhagen which was also good, but not as miraculous as some would say.\n\nAnd lastly, which probably would not matter to most, they do not have their nutrition facts on their website or on site. I requested the calorie count (thanks to my recent sign up with My Fitness Pal) and they said they don't know any or have any nutrition facts on their foods. So I just pretended I only consumed 200 calories for the Kringle :p. Was that wrong?",

I'm going to have to put $5 into the douchebag jar for saying this, but I've been craving real danishes since I got back from Copenhagen a while back. Imagine my excitement when I heard about this bakery!\n\nCopenhagen Pastry only opened about 6 months ago but I'm sure they'll be around for a while if they keep producing these delicious pastries. Everything is freshly baked throughout the day so you don't have to worry about getting stuff that's been sitting out for a while just because you've come by in the afternoon (even though they're still damn good after a day or two!).\n\nMy favorites are the apple pastry (fresh apple bits) and the Kringle (almondy). If you're not sure what to get, they usually have samples on the counter for you to try. The pastries are really flaky and crispy, and don't taste like they're drenched in butter/sugar like most other \"danishes\" you get elsewhere.\n\nTeeny tiny parking lot on the side and some parking on the streets. The people that run this bakery are really nice and helpful.\nKringle, chocolate pastry, Flodeboller and coconut top cakes, copenhagen pastry, and apple pastry",

The owner (I believe she was the owner) was very sweet and talked to us about how she grew up in Denmark and how her mother taught her how to bake...and thus that they make their own jams in-house. She asked how we found out about her bakery, and thus we bonded a little over the Great British Baking Show (my friend was looking for a nougat crown and searched it on Yelp).\n\nWe were offered small samples of several different pastries, all delicious and wonderfully baked (as Mary or Paul would say?!), and all of which were not too sweet and had lovely flavors. The owner and the other lady working would make suggestions and talk about each type of pastry while we were deciding which ones to get. They were also not too expensive, as pastries can sometimes get in LA. In the end, I took home a spandauer, a nougat crown, and a Copenhagen. Next time, I'm definitely going to bring home a big box of pastries. The custards and fillings in the centers were so good, and I loved the little bits of icing or chocolate on the top of the pastry.\n\nParking was pretty easy to find for me (just street parking), the people there are nice, the pastries are delicious. What's holding you back?? Go get some Copenhagen pastries!!",

I'm weary of american pastries because I generally find them saccharine sweet -- you can never taste the flavors, just all of the sugar on your tongue. No so here. You could taste the butter in the high-qualify flaky pastry surrounding a delicious raspberry jam that had great depth of flavor (am I sensing almond paste here somewhere?), all topped with the thinnest ring of not-too-sweet white frosting. They also have an apple version of this pastry and let's be real, I'm probably gonna go get one tomorrow.\n\nIf you, like me, enjoy eating pastries on the couch while scrolling through Instagram, this raspberry pastry is not for you -- it is seriously flaky as all good pasties should be and will make a mess. Instead, get the cinnamon braid, which is also hella delicious.\n\nBoth pastries cost me less than $5, and there was ample street parking on Saturday afternoon when I was there.\nRaspberry pastry.

These are Danish pastries.\" - Girl at the counter.\n\nA little snooty, but very true.\n\nThe almond kringle, the copenhagen, and the chocolate pastry are the things to get here. I love that you can really taste the almond paste in the kringle, but after a few bites, it can be a little much. The custard is what I love about the copenhagen. The chocolate pastry... it's really just a dollop of chocolate on top of a crispy shell with a soft interior with some custard inside. There's only a whisper of custard, but maybe that's what makes it so good...\n\nWhat tips the scale from 4 to 5 stars is that every time I come here, they always have samples :)\n\nIt's a small, clean space; despite the lack of seating, I still give Copenhagen 5 stars because they do an amazing job of making their chocolate PASTRY crispy on the outside yet soft inside.",

The excuse was always that I had to get a box of their pastries over to another friend to sample, but of course I always left with a bag containing a few items for myself.\n\nI loved that the owner, Karen Hansen, was there to patiently and proudly tell me about Danish pastry and the traditional baking methods they used to produce the items in the display case. Details for each pastry were provided, and by the second or third visit, I had been given a generous sample (and in many cases, multiple samples!) of each item. The flaky crispness of the exterior of their pastries, the soft and airy interior, and the light buttery taste (without any bit of greasiness) impressed me and had me delivering Copenhagen Pastry boxes to friends for second/third/etc. opinions.\n\nVisits were cut back after that summer, but the bakery still remains as an occasional addition to my itinerary when I'm in the mood for one of their pastries. I can never leave without a kringle or two, and an apple or chocolate pastry always seem to end up in my bag as well.  When I cure salmon, a loaf of their rye bread also goes home with me.\n\nSince I live in the area I sometimes take Copenhagen Pastry for granted and forget about them for short periods of time, but a return visit takes me back in time to those initial visits, and renews my appreciation for their commitment to craft and the resulting quality of their pastries.",

The pastry store is pristine and pretty simple in design but bold.  As I perused the display case of pastries the owner  gladly stuffed my face with plenty of free samples.   I really wish I could remember all the proper names for the samples I had.  But ALL of the samples were delightful.  I ended up purchasing the basic danish, another one with a raspberry filling, and one with custard and chocolate.  All of the danishes I brought home we light and flaky and not overly sweet.  My particular favorite was the custard and chocolate one.  Copenhagen's pastries make for great breakfast items or even afternoon/ evening desserts.",

Excellent Tikka Masala, really hearty and pungent. Not typical flavor. I tried the onion uttapam, it's fine. Not my favorite consistency but tasty.  I want to go back and try a Thali at some point. They have easy pickup and some tables set up in a tent in the parking lot. Looking forward to trying more dishes. Everything looked good.\nSee all photos from Judy T. for Mayura Indian Restaurant",

We ordered butter chicken, which had good quality chicken and decent sauce.\n\nWe also ordered palak paneer. This one was a disappointment. It is listed as cubed Indian cheese and stewed spinach with spices. But what we got was basically onion soup, with a bit of spinach puree, and cubed cheese (albeit plenty of it! no need to hunt for it). But we didn't appreciate ordering a spinach dish and having it basically be onion with some cheese in it. It was basically a yellow dish (from the onion). It looked nothing like any of the photos here in yelp. Maybe the chef was having an off night? I had just bought 2 bags of spinach at the grocery, so I don't believe there is a spinach shortage?\n\nWe did, however, get PLENTY of rice. That was unexpected and awesome. First time we couldn't finish the rice with our Indian order. I don't know if we will be back. There are other options in the area.\nPalak paneer, that really ended up being an onion stew with some spinach in it.",

Being a San Diegan with very limited Indian dining options, everything tasted authentic and delicious. The service was quick and portions were huge. Spice levels were in control. We ordered appam and fish curry, puttu and channa, non veg thali and chicken curry. Love their sambar too. Although, We were hoping for a buffet and they dint have one on a weekend night.\nAppam and fish curry. The plate came with 4 appams but we gobbled them before clicking a pic\nPuttu and channa",

It  soaks up curry better than any bread I've ever had.\n\nI'm Indian and their fish curry stands toe to toe with anything I've had in Kerala. It's incredibly well balanced - flavorful but not too overwhelming for a palate accustomed to milder food.  If you can handle a little more flavor, I recommend getting it extra spicy - they do a great job of ratcheting  up the heat without losing any of the flavor.\n\nEverything else I've had here - the chicken curry, the biryani, etc. - has been mediocre. This place, might be a one trick pony, but honestly who cares when that one trick is this good.",

Then comes the final spectacular dish chicken curry.. This one gives the feel of why in the hell you had visited the restaurant.. A gentle and genuine suggestion, please do not visit this restaurant in culver city.. Being Indian I never experienced this sort of taste in Indian cuisine..

While this place is supposed to be both south and north indian - I'd say it's strength are the south indian dishes.\n\nI ordered the Special Dosa while others ordered other vegetarian dishes. The one woman who I was with that ordered meat, didn't like her chicken tikka masala much, and even though I didn't try it - it didn't really pass the eye test for me either. The Dosa's and Samosa's were good though. I'm not naturally a huge Dosa fan but this one exceeded expectations.\n\nI think the service was average, the woman owner seemed to always be smiling and that was nice. The male waiter, however, seemed to be frustrated with us and definitely had the \"sigh\" down. Yeah, I'd go back.",

All the different dosas are how made the way they should be. I'm not a big fan of the potato filling so I get mine plain. Most restaurants don't make the filling correctly anyway. In comparison, the SF Bay Area has Pasand and Udupi palace both of which are excellent in terms of their Madras cuisine. Mayura is the only place I've tried in LA that comes close. I don't get the meat dishes here as that is a whole different type of Indian cuisine and most people who are good at Madras cuisine are not good at make meat dishes.",

They have a lunch buffet which is only $12.00 dollars, a great deal! They offer a variety of vegetarian dishes as well as meat options. My favorite dish their is the shrimp masala with garlic naan. I go to Mayura's about twice a month. The owner's Padmini and her husband are the nicest people that you will ever meet. This is one the best Indian places on the Westside. :-)",

The chicken biryani and the chicken tikka masala are favorites.  This place is proof that some of LA's best restaurants can be found in strip malls.  Strange, but totally true.",

                  "review": "On a raining night, a very cold and wet night, driving across town was motivated by unseen fragrances of pungent aromas and unfamiliar voices. Mayura Restaurant sits in the middle of a little mall not far from the Sony Studios. Walking through the parking lot's shallow pools of water, brought back memories of rainy London nights, on the very same quest for Indian-Pakistani food. If it is Halal, so much the better. The moment you enter, the aromas are pleasantly strong as you see all the booths along the walls are filled. Bollywood is on the TV as someone takes you to a table. The water is good, tasting better than regular tap. The menus are well laid out, food easy to understand. Now, sitting there, if you close your eyes and maybe you should, you can drift away in a raga, floating in a sitar's song. The place was busy and it wasn't like nothing was happening, you may not get your order in for a while. But you will receive the likable water because that is all you will have for a while. When your order is taken, you may notice the waiter could be the slowest writer in the world. Maybe he was working on a novel because as I ordered garlic naan, it looked like he was writing much more. But later, the waiter proved reliable, the food was exactly as ordered. After awhile, the raga blends with the beautiful smells and the Bollywood laugh track fills the air with gaiety. The hostess comes by with some papadums and its chill. Then the food comes. Veggie choices come with rice and raita, we had \"palak paneer\", curry with fresh spinach and Indian cheese. Nice size serving of the dish. Nehari, a classic Pakistani beef dish, with a delicious spicy reddish brown sauce. The Mysore Masala Dosa, a crispy crepe filled with chilies and curry potatoes accompanied with coconut chutney and a robust little bowl of vegetable soup. The Dosa can be a meal in and of itself. Some garlic naan and paratha, with three dishes and there was too much food for two. Be prepared to have a leisurely meal, where patience will be rewarded with some good food at very reasonable prices.",

The server starts you off with salsa and chips. We ordered the Plato Tipico (Sampler Platter) and Camarones a la Diabla (spicy shrimp). Both dishes were super flavorful and delicious!!! The Plato Tipico is basically a sampler of your typical Salvadoran food - rice, beans, 1 pupusa (I got the pork and cheese), chicharr\u00f3n, fried sweet potatoes and fried plantains. The chicharr\u00f3n was tender and had a nice crisp on the outside - super easy to cut with your knife! You can't go wrong with the rice, beans and pupusa; the plantains were a perfect touch at the end of the meal!! I would highly recommend starting off with this platter if you haven't been to this restaurant before.\n\nThe Camarones a la Diabla was delicious as well! This dish is served with rice, beans and shrimp with spicy sauce, along with bell peppers, onions and your choice of corn/flour tortilla. It had the PERFECT amount of spice to it. My friend really enjoyed this dish.\n\nI am definitely coming back, but this time around, I'll be sure to try the Seven Seas Soup!\n\nParking - small lot\nStaff - friendly and attentive\nGreat and cozy ambiance\nPlato Tipico (Salvadoran Sampler Platter) and Camarones a la Diabla",

I suppose that isn't a big surprise... everything inside screams, family owned and hands on. Handmade salsa, fresh om house chips and food prepared when ordered.\n\nLove went into each of the 11 main dishes we wanted that evening. I didn't get to try anything other than my dish, but whenever anyone took a bite, the look of contentment spread over their face.\n\nI certainly do not think anything we ordered is superb, as far as culinary fare goes, we are here for a middle of the road authentic El Salvadorian experience, akin to what we may experience on a future trip to someone's home or decent restaurant someplace ... my beef for example was a little tough, it was slow cooked for a long time from what I gather, so I did expect it to be fall apart fork tender, and refried beans and rice, although delicious, was not expected to be gourmet.\n\nKneeways, my criteria is always, does this place achieve what it set out to do? Yes? 5 stars. So go check Gloria's joint out. It represents well on all fronts.. and chat with Gloria!\nUseful 3\nFunny 2\nCool 3\nGloria F.\nBusiness Owner",

The nice thing was the man brought the food out to our car.\nI always usually check my food since when it's a big order people usually forget something, but we didn't because there were homeless people hanging out front with no masks on.\nSo we went straight to the park to eat.\nWe weren't given part of our order, no napkins, no utensils, and my husband ordered soup!\nWe called them to tell them about this and the person on the phone was very unapologetic and in every way and only offered to credit us the food they forgot. No apology for not giving the utensils, or napkins, he told my husband we didn't give you utensils bc we thought you were going to take it home. Huh??\nAnyways, the food was decent.\nI ordered fish tacos, and my kids got the steak and chicken fajitas. Both were very good. My daughter said the pupusas were ok, and the 7 seas soup probably was good if my husband could've tasted it. $22 down the hole.\nSo all in all, I won't be back. Too expensive, parking sucks, vagrants out front. We spent $85 for bad customer service and decent food.",

They take care of you here.\n\nMy favorite things to order are chille relleno, pupusas, shrimp with garlic sauce, and carne adobada. I also enjoy their sangria.

                  "review": "I sought Gloria's out a couple years ago after seeing it featured on Food Network 's \"Diners,  Drive-ins and Dives\" and I've been a loyal patron ever since.  I've taken many friends here and it's one of our go-to spots when we can't decide what we want to eat - -  we all know,  you can't go wrong with Gloria' s.  \n\nThe stellar items on the menu are the carne adobada,  an immensely tender and flavorful slow cooked pork served with rice, beans and tortillas,  and the seafood soup.  These were the dishes featured on DDD,  and are truly incomparable. I've also had the fish tacos and chicken fajitas,  which were very tasty,  but dishes that you could find at any other Mexican restaurant.  If you want something truly unique and incomparably well executed,  stick with the soup or adobada. And you must order the Plato Typico,  a sampler appetizer platter featuring a plethora of El Salvadoran culinary concoctions including pupusas (cooked to crisp yet tender perfection and served with a tangy slaw and salsa ), yucca fries and pieces of fried pork.  \n\nIf you are lucky,  Gloria,  the owner, may even be there to say hi or take your order!\n\nDo yourself a favor and order a pitcher of Sangria.  It is potent stuff,  and some of the best Sangria I've ever tasted.  If you are not in the mood for alcohol,  consider an horchata.  Get some tamales to go too!  Mexican tamales are made in a corn husk,  El Salvadoran in a banana leaf.  Both types are absolutely delish.\n\nThere is a small parking lot out front,  but good luck finding a space there.  There is street parking to be had,  but it may be a bit of a walk.",

                  "review": "It pains me to give such a poor review but I would love to see this new business get its act together and thrive.  There is nothing more than I would like than to have a good Indian option in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, this Indian food is just not good.  I need to mention that, although I am not Indian, I have many decades of enjoying Indian cuisine and dine often in \"Little India\" near Artesia.  I am not expecting gourmet cuisine in a neighborhood fast food joint, but I am expecting at least a trace of authenticity.  Much of the food was bland or inexpertly spiced.  The \"Mulligawtawny soup\" , a staple of New York Indian restaurants, was simply inedible.  Their naan, thankfully, was good and if dipped into a passable curry could be used to salvage an otherwise mediocre dish.  I think that the owners and the chefs need to get back to basics and examine the elements that make Indian cuisine some of the best in the world.  I wish I could advise them more thoroughly of what exactly was wrong, but I'm not a chef and am not sure.  Perhaps the herbs and/or the spices aren't fresh?  Perhaps the ratio of these ingredients are off?  Could the potatoes and spinach be sitting around for too long?  Please take a good, long, hard look at your cuisine or else risk losing your business.  I think that some ethnic restaurants occasionally make the mistake of underestimating the culinary discernment of the average American diner.  It is usually a bad gamble.",

They do not offer bottomless mimosas but you can buy a bottle of champagne for $30.\nThe service was mediocre, drinks came out the same Time the food came out. The orange juice was thick af really 100% pulp it was like a pulp smoothie. Do not recommend it is not refreshing.\nAlthough, the Chilaquiles were amazing! The salsa rojo was fire i added some peppers on top so those don't come with it. The are very generous on guac!! The carne asada complimented the dish so well. 10/10 recommend!",

Flavorful but so mushy.\nThe omelet is nice if we were okay with cilantro, but for two people who don't like cilantro it was just a little too much. Flavor wise pretty good. Hard to judge.\nNot really an omelet just an egg wrap on top of plentiful filling.\nJam pretty good.\n\n7/10 if we liked cilantro.\n\nBreakfast sandwich\nVery standard: egg, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, red onion, bacon. Meh. Would not get again. (This was a backup choice because I was going to order the breakfast wrap but was told there was cilantro in it. I do not like cilantro)\n4/10\n\nBlueberry corn cakes\nReally good! Favorite thing we ordered. We liked this more than traditional pancakes. Light and easy to easy. Fluffy but a little crispy.  \n10/10\n\nService  \nA little slow because it was busy. Felt like we were forgotten for a while. We waited a long time for our food. We had to ask twice for water.

I started with the Ginger Root Lemonade, which may I say is exceptionally refreshing. The ginger root hits the throat.\n\nFor my main course, I had the Blacken Salmon Fish Tacos. The Blacken Fish Tacos simply has corn tortillas with mozzarella, pick de Gallo, cabbage, lemon cucumber yogurt sauce, serve with black beans and Spanish brown rice. It was decent, I would ask for some sauce to put on the blackened fish. I added Tapatio and this chili sauce they brought out. The Spanish brown rice is decent paired with the black beans. Brown rice has a distinctive flavor, so it's usually best to pair with beans, veggies, or some kind of gravy.\n\nMy wife had the chilaquiles rojos, which she enjoyed. Her only concern was she wished it came with an additional side because she was still a bit hungry after eating it.\n\nAll in all, I'd return. I'm interested in trying something different and the vibe is awesome. A good place to talk, drink and eat.",

I'm from a restaurant family and both of my kids have been/are servers.\nDanny was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. When I asked about recommendations, he kindly mentioned 1-2 items per section and pointed them out on the menu instead of leaving it for me to find after he walked away. He noticed when my tacos got a bit messy and walked over with extra napkins before I even had to ask!\n\nCafe Vida, you have a star working for you.

I love all the healthy options they have (and, of course, the not so healthy too!).  I had the chipotle chicken sandwich on Ciabatta with fries (ok, I went for the not so healthy this time!).  It was very tasty and fresh.  I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a great breakfast, lunch or brunch place.  I would give it 5 stars except, unfortunately, the service was not good.",

The bun soft and perfect. This is a knife fork no hands. The Arnold Palmer hand and well made. A place I will return to again and again",

Bits of my toast and some of my scrambled eggs were still on the plate. We had only been there for 40 minutes and the place wasn't even busy.  We'll go back because they have good food, but hopefully we'll get a more patient waitress.",

I just have to address that when I mentioned that one of my takeout orders were incorrect, it definitely could have been handled better. I had 9 orders, which I know is a lot, and I know mistakes happen but I do not feel that I should have been the one apologizing. I worked in a restaurant for years and in my experience the costumer is ALWAYS right, 100%. I didn't receive a single apology, instead I was told that I said the order wrong, which could be possible but I'm not sure how \"fish tacos\" sound like \"adobo\" and I read the order as written by my boss but that is beside the point. The person I assume is a manager tried to convince me not to wait because it would take 15-20 min and I received numerous confused looks when I said I would wait. In my opinion all you have to say is a simple sorry and get them what they said they ordered. Point, blank, period. The costumer shouldn't have to apologize ever. But like I said the food and atmosphere are great and I'm sure the staff is too, just would have liked the situation to be handled in a different manner.",

When I arrived I approached the counter and waited patiently while someone was prepping an order. I was never acknowledged but I figured he was working on an order so I'll be patient. Finally after awhile one of the customers who was waiting for an order approached me and told me the service is automated and to use the Ipad kiosk to place and complete my order. He said he learned that after his first visit. It would be nice if I was told that by the staff member or perhaps a sign to that effect would be helpful.

The store is definitely more of a grab and go establishment as it is very small and there's only a few high tables inside and out. I would love to see them expand into more of a restaurant so that I could sit and hangout here, but the food is so fresh & the burrata makes it even better. I ordered the crudo panini and the bresaola bowl. So so good! Definitely on the pricier side, but it is so worth it if you're a burrata fan. The burrata is gooey and the meat is delicious. I would eat here everyday if they were closer. They just opened up a location in Hollywood that I've been meaning to try. So happy that this place opened!!",

The caprese was light and fresh, but filling, and the burrata had that soft mozzarella bite, with its cream filling spilling over as a light sauce to tie the sandwhich together. The crudo adds prosciuitto, which compliments the butteriness of the burrata very well!\n\nThe sandwich portions do look small for the price, but they do leave you feeling satisfied without feeling heavy like other panini.\n\nThe shop is nested in a small mixed-business plaza with limited and tight parking!",

There was a dipping sauce that was creamy and light!\n\nI also ordered the Saag Paneer.  This went well with the Cheese Naan I used for scooping up the creamy goodness of the spinach.  Oink!\n\nI started to get full so I waited about ~30 mins to get started on the Chicken Korma.  This is served with perfectly cooked rice and the chicken was wonderfully tender and moist!  The sauce was very nice because it wasn't overpowered by the curry cocoon milk with the cream sauce.  This was creamy and fragrant and not too smoky in smell as some curry dishes tend to be.\n\nI want to try the Chow Chow next and the Himalayan Iced Tea along with the other dishes.  I ordered plenty of food and I still have leftovers!\n\nWith delivery total $30.28 + 20% to the friendly driver, my dinner was money well-spent.  I am quite pleased with this establishment.\n\nAlso to note:  10% of any profit the restaurant earns goes toward assisting women and children education in Nepal as per the front of the pre-printed takeaway menu.  \n\nThis is definitely a local business to support!",

At the risk of sounding overly superlative, this really is the best place in LA to eat, in my opinion.  \n\nEverything is consistently tasty and I never feel anything but fully sated after eating here.  Highlights include the korma, the saag, the eggplant curry, okra saute, any of the stews and sekuwas, and of course the Yak Chili.  The Naan and Papadums are great too. Tara always greets you with a smile, and you can tell that everyone here cares about the food you eat.  They make you feel like part of the family.\n\nThey even have a frequent eater's card.  Every six meals, you get one meal free. I have burned through many of these. I feel blessed to live so close to this place.",

I was expecting the chicken in the chicken tikka masala to be dry, but it was actually really tender and flavorful especially for being all white meat. I would definitely be back again.",

A cozy little space in the back for larger parties with a curtain for a touch of seclusion - must make reservations for this area.\n\nWe started off with the Kothey Momo - six handmade chicken dumplings, pan fried and served with fresh tomato achaar. Nothing special. Kind of bland. Basically identical to a mediocre potsticker.\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the fresh Salmon -  marinated overnight in Himalayan spices, cooked in clay oven. I was not happy with this dish at all. Too fishy, and again - kind of bland. I liked the presentation though - on a sizzling patter.  But unfortunately, the taste did not come close to matching the appearance.\n\nThe House Special Platter - combination of chicken tikka, tandoori chicken, lamb kebobs and tandoori shrimp served on a sizzling platter with fresh vegetables. This was much tastier than the Salmon tandoori, thankfully. Chicken was a bit dry though, lamb was cooked well and had a nice spice.\n\nNot entirely thrilled with our choices thus far, we decided to order what this place is known for - the Yak chili - boneless sliced Yak, saut\u00e9ed with fresh ginger, garlic, onion, tomato and bell pepper. YUM. I would come back for this dish and based on my last experience, ONLY this dish.\n\nAnd next time I would like to try the Yetti beer with my Yak chili.\n\nYakety yak, don't talk back!\nYak chili",

Sirtaj in 90210 is not perfect but one notch better and has probably the nicest hip setting as Indian rests go.  Try them.  We really don't have great Indian in LA.  I am not sure it exists.

I am sure there probably is.\n\nIt is very similar to indian food in my experience.  Some dishes like tikka masala or lamb vindaloo you can find both at indian cuisine and at taras.  If you like indian food, you will really like taras.\n\nMy favorite dishes here are likely the Lamb Vindaloo, the Jackfruit Curry, and the Korma.  \n\nThe lamb vindaloo comes spicy, but if you ask, and be emphatic, they can make it super duper spicy, which is how I like it.  I have asked before to make it very spicy , and it was hot, but not spicy enough, so now when I ask I really tell them I'm serious, that I want it burning hot, and it comes out perfect.  \n\nThe jackfruit curry is exceptional.  It has an amazing texture and flavor.  Anytime I want a veggie curry this i what I order.  The flavors are really good.\n\nThe korma is also amazing.  Its executed very well and is just the right level of creaminess.  It is a bit more filling than the others because of the cream, but it has that flavor where you could just eat it all day too it seems.\n\nTheir naan is not exactly like naan found at indian food places.  I am not sure but I figure this must be because its himalyaa.  The best one I have found is the keema naan which has some ground beef in it, and its really flavorful.  \n\nFinally, they deliver, right through yelp.  I happen to live pretty close and after I discovered this its become regular, probably too regular hah, but it is exceptionally tasty.

All right, all right, it's like Indian only with 'Himalayan spices' and then....\n\nYak chili.\n\nAllow me to repeat... Yak chili.\n\nIf you're new to the Himalayas, yak is Himalayan for yak.\n\nOkay, it's on.\n\nThe yak chili was my favorite of the main dishes.  The yak is sliced thin, and a little dry, tending toward jerky, but not quite that tough and preserved.  Yak is more or less a fancy cow, and tastes fairly beefy.  The spices and veggies that go with it made it a great dish.\n\nAlso had chicken saag, or whatever the Nepali for chicken and spinach is.  It was fine, though the spinach had more cinnamon (?) than I really cared for.\n\nWe also had a few different appetizery things, and they were all quite good.\n\nThe naan, however, was a bit sad.  Not a strong point.\n\nStill, really solid good food.",

But it's what you always want from pizza: the balance of perfect crust size, just the right amount of flavorful sauce, and some tasty toppings.\n\nI try to get a pizza at least once a week, but if I walked by this place on a daily basis I would easily eat here every day.  In fact, I lived just a half block away and loved the convenience of putting in my order, going home for a beer, then walking back.  Now I call ahead.  You may have a wait as little as 15min or as long as an hour.  It's worth it either way.  I've put in the call, and went straight out the door only to have my beautiful pizza waiting for me.\n\nYou can also play the lottery and take whatever pizza happens to be there by the slice.  I've done this before, and it makes for a tasty game.  They can also add any toppings to the cheese.\n\nIs it cheap?  Well, it's not Domino's cheap.  But, you also don't feel like you just drank a cup of canola oil.  The extra large goes for about $15 just cheese; about $2 an extra topping, so a good XL will run you under $20.  Again, this isn't a heavy pizza, but not paper thin, so an XL will feed maybe 5 people, or 4 hungry people.  It plays well with salad, too.\n\nYou can really taste the fresh ingredients.  And walk in, you'll feel like part of the family.  Yes, sometimes you accidentally walk in on an argument.  Oh well, family restaurant, deal with it.  They do it cuz they love the business, and they especially really love the customers.  Whenever they're slammed with too much business, I smile and wait.  I wouldn't do that for other places, but this is some phenomenal pizza.",

My friend was over and we had both had a terrible week, decided screw the diet, time for a pizza and wine recoup night.  I wanted to try something new and had not ordered pizza in months, decided on this place.\n\nOrdered a large pizza with extra cheese, red onion, mushroom, olives, pineapple, and jalapenos (I'm pescatarian usually).  And it was delicious.  Delivery did take an hour, which is a long time to wait but was worth it.  Nice thin crust, very tasty.  It did come to almost $20 but since I order pizza so rarely it was a really nice treat.  We had an awesome relaxing night, and I finished the leftovers the next day.  I only ever pay cash so that was no problem.  Great job!",

Their cheese pie is blissful, but was very disappointed tonight when I ordered meatball and tomato at $1.75 per topping and was given either one small crumble of meatball per extra-large slice or none at all. Mind you not a chunk or slice of meatball, a very small piece of meatball the size of the tip of my pinky. There was a smattering of tomato pieces over the entire pie. I gave the manager, who had made the pizza, a chance to resolve my dissatisfaction with the paltry toppings on my pizza while I was still paying at the counter and showed him politely how some of the individual slices actually didn't have any meatball at all. (Mind you, these are slices of an extra large pizza so the slices are huge.) He agreed with my assessment and told me there was a whole meatball on the pizza. He told me meatballs are expensive. Then he said maybe he should have crumbled the meatball bits into tinier bits so it looked like more on the pizza. When he saw the incredulity on my face at that being his idea for a possible resolution to this problem, even he realized the answer was was not a good one. With that he shrugged his shoulders, sadly shook his head and said he guessed he would have to start charging more. It was all very surreal. In the future I will stick with my old stand-by cheese pizza and enjoy one of the better pizzas on the Westside.\nDelicious pizza but don't pay for any toppings. Stick with cheese only.",

The Soto Mie was delicious. However, the Chicken Sate was too sweet, and the Beef Rendang had a lack of spice and tasted kind of strange (IMO Ramayani makes way better Rendang).\n\nNot gonna lie, I'm quite disappointed in the food from Mr. Sate.

I'm currently sick right now and its doing wonders for my throat. Absolutely perfect for when you're sick. The egg in the soup also absorbed all the favors.\n\nThe beef skewer is just one skewer with about three bites worth of meet. Its wonderful seasoned and was a great side.\n\nDefinitely will bring friends here to try out other items on the menu.",

The corn fritters(bakwan jagung) were really good and definitely reminded me of home since you can't typically find restaurants that do it right. Their Soto ayam was also much more flavorful compared to other places I've tried. Their peanut sauce for the gado gado and sate ayam(chicken skewers) tastes really good and traditional. Unlike other places where it has a peanut butter taste to it. I will for sure come back and try other things on the menu!\nSee all photos from Jacqueline D. for Mr. Sate",

The woman who rang me up was very friendly, walked me through the menu. I got the MMM salad with turkey added on. They don't add chicken to their salads.\n\nI also got an iced latte with almond milk. Their almond milk is home made (delicious!) and they add cinnamon (the flavor is strong)\n\nI'm definitely coming back here!",

Even during a weekday lunch, I waited 15 minutes despite being the only one being served.\n\n3) Food quality and portion size leaves a lot to be desired. Both my meals were a bit bland and over salted. The ingredients were nice, but for some reason, nothing came together - especially at $13/entree.\n\n4) They have a \"C\" health rating.

Good luck parking in the lot during brunch/lunch. If not, you have to go into the neighborhood / street parking, which is equally as ridiculous.\n\n2) Service was rushed and felt like they were running 80mph. It was so crazy but the restaurant was only 70-75% filled. Servers were dropping plates, coffee barista was running to give people their orders. So none of the \"what would you recommend?\" - u better know what you want to order, since everyone behind you will be waiting. (Order first, then sit down). The environment felt too crazy, flustering and almost like a madhouse at times.\n\nAlso I ordered a croissant for $3 and couldn't chew through it - it was so tough.

It's got all of the hipster trappings: beautiful art, lots of kale, nut based milk, kombucha, and yet somehow, delightfully, is unpretentious, reasonably priced and downright delicious.   My son and I came in for lunch for the first time last week and were just blown away.  I loved the  decor and the staff couldn't have been friendlier .  We were even more impressed when the food came: I had the veggie wrap as a bowl -- full of delicious mushrooms, brown rice, scrambled eggs, kale, cabbage, and loaded with flavor from the pesto dressing.  It was healthy and delicious.  My son had the Chicken Cubano Banh Mi Sandwich which was equally delicious and served with a beautiful green salad.  All the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. Our lovely server even brought my son a cookie on the house at the end of the meal.  C&M is my new go-to place.  I just wish they were open for dinner!",

But my favorite of all has always been Culver City. They just seemed to get it right most of the time from the food to the service.  Unfortunately, tonight that was not the case. My friend and I arrived one hour before closing on a Friday evening.  We were greeted by a young man who just minutes before was standing in the doorway of the restaurant.  We were confused by that, but continued to come in.  The problem began with the preparation of our food. The staff was talking back and forth with one another, speaking in other languages, however, continually looking back at us. That was weird. The cashier was obviously mad and took it out on every patron that came to pay, including myself.  He was unfriendly, continued to look down when we were asking him questions, never responded when I personally thanked him and just walked away.  The young lady who was working next to him asked him if he were ok and he mumbled something rude to her as well and she just responded oh and put her head down.  They were and always seem to be out of silverware and when the workers started making our plates, they literally threw the items on the plate so hard they ended up looking like a Pollack painting.  We love the food, but the service has gone down considerably. I may not be back, despite the food.  Management please get it together!  I give it a 3 for the food.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nGuest Services ..\nBusiness Owner\n8/14/2018\nHi Karen,\n\nI'm so sorry about this. I would love to connect and follow up with the team.

For me, the unique thing about Tender Greens with the quality and quantity of meat in things like the Chipolte Chicken Salad I ordered today, but mine had very little chicken, half of which was chopped up pieces of skin. Also, there seemed to be a high proportion of stalk to leaf in the lettuce.\nI had a similar experience a  few months ago. For the first year, the food was consistently excellent. I might try one more time, but if I get another salad like today, I'll return it to the kitchen.",

Yummers! I also got a side order of corn, which had a hint of Indian flavor to it. I could munch on it anytime of the day.\n\nSERVICE: The place runs like a cafeteria. You buy your food and sit. But there were semi-waiters who attend to your needs. They assist with a smile.\n\nOUTDOOR DINING AREA: yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 The exterior has heaters. There was live music playing next door at Ford's Filling Station, so it was quite nice.

Then I asked if they bring the food to you.  Oops, forgot that part too - you have to wait by the counter for your food.  But since it wasn't busy the woman ringing me up said she'd bring it out to me.\n\nI liked my GRILLED VEGGIE big salad.  Something about hot veggies on cold, crisp lettuce is so yummy, especially with just the right amount of dressing.\n\nLike many of the restaurants in downtown Culver City, the outdoor/sidewalk patio is spacious.

                  "review": "I went to Tender Greens a long time ago, and I didn't care for it at all.  On my recent visit, I had a much better experience.  Tender Greens is an order-at-the-counter place that focuses on salads.  The menu is pretty simple--you can get a simple salad with meat, a special salad, a meat plate, or a sandwich--each $10.50.  You can also get a \"simple salad\" (without meat) for $5.50.\n\nI went with one of the simple salads with meat.  My salad consisted of baby spinach, goat cheese, hazelnuts, chicken, and cabernet vinaigrette (an oversized crouton was also served).  At first, I thought they were a little stingy with the goat cheese and hazelnuts.  But after eating more and more of the salad, I realized that it was just not that well tossed.\n\nThe salad was fine.  The goat cheese was kind of boring.  They should have just used smaller croutons instead of one large one.  The other problem was that the vinaigrette was very light (you couldn't really identify it).  I prefer my salads underdressed as opposed to overdressed, but it was pretty bland.\n\nThe chicken was very good.  They give you a substantial portion, and it was surprisingly moist.  If I came back, I would go for the tuna, which looked good.\n\nThere was quite a long line so you do have to wait.  The seating area was nice.  The inside dining area was a little crammed; plus, it became quite loud with very lively patrons.  I did like the outdoor dining area.  Even though it is a small restaurant, they do have a good number of tables.  Parking is free for 2 hours in the nearby structure.\n\nWhile I did not think my salad here was anything great, it was good enough that I would come back and give one of their other offerings a chance.",

Thick pieces of grilled zucchini, accompanied by eggplant and carrots, it was all too good NOT to finish in one sitting.  My gf ordered the same thing but as a \"hot plate,\" so she got the grilled veggies with mashed potatoes and something else that I can't remember right now.  \n\nIt was too cold (yes, even in LA it gets \"cold\" at night) to sit outside, so we sat inside.  Fortunately, there were still tables to choose from when we got our food.  By the time we were leaving, people were hovering waiting for a table to open up.  \n\nI will DEFINITELY be back.  So many different things to try.  The only downer to this experience - the bitchy cashier.  But overall, the rest of the crew behind the counter seemed nice.",

Seriously though, from the street we could already see the line and we hadn't even parked yet!! But we were in it for the long haul so to the line we went!\n\nThe line went pretty quickly for being as long as it was, and the cashier was really friendly, and told me that my two options the chipotle barbeque chicken salad and the flank steak sandwich with side salad were the two best things on the menu--but then didn't really help me choose which one was actually better!! I HATE THAT! I asked you for which was better? Don't tell me both!!! I obviously already am indecisive, don't add to it!! ha ha\n\nBut I went with the grilled flank steak sandwich which was served on ciabatta bread with these delicious red peppers that were a piece of heaven all on their own!!! But I am not gonna lie when I say that I wish I had ordered the steak as part of a plate than a sandwich because I literally felt like a carnivore ripping meat from my prey when trying to bite from my sandwich!! The pieces were so thick and chewy it definitely took some effort! My side salad which was the baby spinach with goat cheese and walnuts was pretty good, but a little light on the goat cheese....MORE GOAT CHEESE PLEASE! ha\n\nMy two friends Amanda and Terra both got the happy vegan salad but Amanda added Ahi on the top of her's (yes yes, defeats the purpose of it being vegan ha ha, we know) and they were both pretty happy with their choices too! Although we all thought the green stuff was guacamole, when really it is hummus! just a little fyi!!\n\nBut for $10 for most things, it is fresh, tasty, and makes me happy. And if you don't want to be too healthy you can get pitchers here too!!\n\nand p.s. park in the public garage around the corner where you get 2 hours free parking!!! boo-ya!",

The knife with the rotated handle was awkward for me (but my gf liked it better).  \n\nThe line was somewhat long, but it went by quick.

At first  it seemed like not that much food....but I wasn't able to finish it! (Granted I ordered a side of grilled fennel!) I also had  the small spinach salad which was good. The goat cheese went nicely with the steak!\n\nFor those who complained about the food being bland, they do have salt & pepper shakers at the end of the counter near where you pay so you can season to taste. This is probably better than some restaurants that do over season their food!\n\nWill I return? Yes....probably.\n\n--------------\nSome people hate leftovers. Others judge the goodness of a meal by its leftoverability. Yes, I just made up a word. But anyways, Tender Greens made for some good leftovers! It tasted like food a friend who knows how to cook would make and sends you home with leftovers. Good stuff!",

I ended up putting the croutons from my salad in the soup, they got all soft and pregnant with tomatoey goodness! Yuummy.\n\nIt's a little pricey, considering it's just salad.

I suppose next time I should just stick to the tried-and-true and non-seasonal type menus. What a disappointment though, because you can still make an amazing salad using things that are IN season.\n\nAlso, their mint lemonade looks tired and isn't really kept circulating in their drink containers. The mint is pulverized to the point that it makes the lemonade look more murky than refreshing.\n\nSorry, Culver City TG. Pasadena wins...",

I loved the mashed potatoes so much. They were super creamy and had a great garlic flavor. but the number one reason i liked this place was their desserts. OMG THEIR DESSERTS. They had muffin tops. very delicious muffins tops.AWESOME LEMON BARS. Great GIANT chocolate muffins. and the BEST oatmeal chocolate chip GIANT ASS cookies i have ever had. I would definitely give their desserts 5 stars but these three stars i gave are based on my entire experience.",

Yeah it's expensive, but what are you going to do? I don't feel like salads are every cheap (and if they are, you're probably getting some crappy ice berg lettuce with shredded carrots. no thanks).\n\nI wish the prawns were less cooked, but the salad was awesome. And so were the potatoes, I don't want to know what goes into them- they're so buttery and fluffy.",

I ordered the Backyard Marinated Steak sandwhich on ciabatta with a side salad of baby arugula w/ balsamic vinaigrette.  The bread was perfectly grilled and buttered, the steak was tender and seasoned just right, and finished off with roasted red bell peppers....so good.  I also stuffed the salad into the sandwhich and it added another texture and made it so much better cuz the dressing went perfectly with the steak...im gettin hungry just writing this!  AND i leaned over and had some of my hubby's mashed potatoes...so creamy, buttery, well seasoned, and a great smooth texture that screams perfect mashed potatoes!!  They gotz beer too!  Great place to eat.  Me hungry now.",

                  "review": "2 photos\nPurchased a Yelp Deal\n*Scroll to the bottom for the cliff notes version.\n\nCame here for the first time on Taco Tuesday.  I live down the street so I thought it would be really convenient for a quick meal before I got back to studying.\n\nGot seated fairly quickly (came at around 7PM-- metered street parking ends at 8PM!).  Free chips and salsa when you arrive.  The chips are amazing and taste SO fresh, and the salsa has a great spicy kick to it (but not too spicy, pretty much just perfect).  While we were waiting to order there was a guy who got his take out order called out loud and it was just for chips and guacamole.  I wondered why anyone would ever just order chips and guacamole from a restaurant... but after eating the chips with the free salsa, I totally get it.  \n\nAnyways, the deals for Taco Tuesday are $2 for beef or carne asada tacos, and possibly chicken too (?) but I could be making that last one up.  Also, $3 for shrimp or fish tacos.  After one bite I was convinced that they had to be some of the best tacos I've had.  They definitely give such generous portions of shrimp and meat, especially in comparison to other places that give you like 3 pieces of shrimp (lame).\n\nThe presentation of the tacos was also really nice.  The food looked very neat and appetizing, which is big to me since I eat with my eyes before anything. Mmm.\n\nSo pretty much the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars, and almost submitted this with a mere 3 stars is because there were barely any people in the restaurant but it took us about 15 minutes to get our order taken (which we didn't really mind since we had the chips to occupy/distract us), and another 35/45 minutes to get the food brought out to us.  I'm pretty sure I'm not exaggerating 'cause we got there at around 7PM and didn't leave 'til close to 9PM... and we didn't send much time talking over the food because by the time it got to us we were so hungry we just started stuffing our faces.\n\nIt's a bold statement to make, but how good the tacos were pretty much evenly outweighed how frustrated we were for the long wait-- it's rare that a place is able to do that!\n\nOH another reason I got a little less frustrated for how long the wait was: When the waitress was taking our drink orders she told me they were all out of lemonade (bummer, right?), but half way through the meal she realized they had some and offered to bring me a glass free of charge! I turned it down just because I had a full glass of iced tea infront of me and didn't want to waste it... but how nice was it for her to have offered!  She also checked in with us frequently throughout the meal to make sure we were doing alright... maybe she knew that the food kinda took extra long? But when she asked how something tasted, the margarita for example, she really wanted to know what we thought.  She told us that two people earlier that day told her that the margarita didn't taste that great, so at least they truly are open to constructive feedback.\n\nOkay, CLIFF NOTES:\n- Parking: metered parking in front and on the adjacent streets (free after 8PM)\n- Food: Amazing.  Came for Taco Tuesdays but will definitely come back to try other things on the menu. AND apparently they deliver? Bonus points.\n- Service: The food took unusually long to come out to us, but the waitress herself was very pleasant and helpful!\nVariety: shrimp, carne asada, and fish tacos!\nChecked in on yelp for the \"$10 for 60\" deal & no one knew what it was for. Haha. Let's say 60 tequila shots & call it a day.",

                  "review": "My friend and I made a decision to have dinner here last night. I've passed this place several times having worked in Century City a few years ago taking Motor Avenue home and have never tried it. Even had a recommendation from a coworker that this was the place that serves a 'pregnant' burrito. A pregnant burrito, you say? Please sign me up!\n\nWe both luck up on street parking ($8-10 to park in a lot on Motor? No thanks; it's cheaper to park at a meter at 6:45 pm.) and walk in to a somewhat empty establishment. No worries, it's just starting to hit dinner and the emptiness is welcomed. She and I look around at the other patron's plates for ideas as to what we should order. So far, the queso with chorizo looks like a hit, so we order it as well as a margarita from the happy hour menu. Pretty good but awfully cheesy. No complaints, we eat it with the tortillas given to us with the dip and the complimentary chips and salsa. We finally make a decision to order entrees; both of us order enchiladas...mine are shrimp with the green sauce and hers are one chicken and one cheese with green sauce. During this time we still eat chips and salsa.\n\nAbout 15-20 minutes later her plate arrives. Looks great. She digs in. Mine will be just a few moments more. Okay. Still eating chips and salsa and onto the second margarita, no big deal. My plate, or what I thought would be my plate, arrives. The enchiladas look awfully flat but everyone has their own techniques. I take a cut into the enchilada and...something is missing. It's awfully cheesy. My friend, who is about halfway done with her meal asks me what my problem is. I say there's no shrimp. I open the enchilada wide open and surely enough, no shrimp, just cheese. As soon as I'm about to say something two customers that are sitting behind me have a complaint. One of them has shrimp enchiladas when she ordered cheese. I quickly recall the two servers, one a guy and the other a woman, the woman asked the guy if he served the correct plates of food to the correct tables. He said he did. Fast forward to the current moment where the lady behind me is complaining and I'm waiting to say something, the woman server comes over and apologizes, explaining that the wrong plate was served and that I'll get my order soon. Back to chips and salsa with congealed queso. During this time my friend is done with her meal, I politely joke with the person behind me about her plate, and the servers have come to my table three times to apologize. By the time I do get the right plate I'm full and barely have the room to enjoy my meal. At this point I ask for a box.\n\nCoincidentally we quickly get the check after being asked if we liked the meals. No compensation for the error sans apologies. I came here to have dinner with my friend, not just chips and drinks. The only reason I tipped, and I shouldn't have at all, was because my friend said I'd look bad if I didn't and she did. My mistake entirely. Considering shrimp is a $3 addition, perhaps they should have been free? Or the meal entirely? Nope, not even. Talk about a disappointment.",

They have a beautiful little bar area, candle light, and somehow manage to offer plenty of seating in a considerably small floor plan.\n\nThis is the BEST place to go for mol\u00e9! I always order the Mol\u00e9 Negro dish, often with a mouth watering appetizer. I have yet to find any place in Los Angeles that can rival what this place has to offer.

I did say no beans but I got no lettuce or oaxaque\u00f1o burrito. I also ordered shrimp and that wasn't added. I really wanted a shrimp burrito with steak but got this. Being a new mom with a new born at home this was my dinner and was really looking forward to this meal. I called and told them I didn't get my shrimp or cheese or lettuce. I was told that I wasn't charged for the shrimp and that was it. So how the hell is it my fault or how was i supposed to know when I told the guy that took my order I wanted shrimp and steam that I was only going to get steak!?... there was no solution. I guess palms residents really like this place. But I probably will be not going back due to this experience. There should have been a solution. I understand their system was down and only accepting cash but they should have protocol in place for stuff like this happens and people are not charged or not charged for the correct orders.\nBurrito oxaque\u00f1o vs what I got",

My faves were their delicious albondigas, rice and beans, beef tacos and chicken taquitos, chips and REAL salsa.  \n\nEl Nopal's staff is always friendly, consistent and accommodating too. Hortencia was like family, along with the other cooking and wait staff thats been there throughout the years. It was a down-home feel up until this last change of ownership which happened about 2wks ago.\n\nI cannot say how incredibly DISAPPOINTED I am.  The entire menu has changed and Oaxacan food has taken its place. Don't get me wrong, I like Oaxacan food - molotes, tlayudas and queso fundido are great but Oaxacan is a COMPLETE different style of \"Mexican\" food (i.e. raisins in taquitos!)\n\nI'm sorry and so sad to say I won't go back...  It's a TRAGEDY that they felt it was necessary to change the menu as much as they did. AND keep the name on top of it.  AWFUL.\n\nBRING BACK \"THE REAL EL NOPAL\"!!!!!!",

I came tonight and my appetizer went to the wrong table. My food arrived just under room temperature. And it took pretty long for me to get my check. At first I thought the waiter must have been slammed with tables, but even when it died down, he was still pretty slow. Up until the very end, I had no idea that our server was our server because it was the manager helping us out the majority of the time because our server was so behind or slow. I asked the manager for the check, then our server came by and I asked him as well, the check must have been forgotten because our server walked by our table, no check in hand, straight into the bathroom. Then about 3 minutes later he walks out and right by our table. Comes by later and then realizes he forgot the check and goes and gets it. The whole time I thought maybe the check was taking a while because it was being adjusted or something but nope LOL",

I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I was blown out of the water with this dish.\n\nI wasn't particularly in the mood for any cocktails, but I did order a non-alcoholic drink. Their homemade strawberry lemonade is AMAZING. It's definitely homemade - you can tell that they blended some strawberries to get the frothy/foamy texture and mixed in some lemonade. It's delicious!\n\nI would love to come back and try some of their other dishes. This place is great!",

Grrr.  \n\nI had the enticing PREGNANT BURRITO filled with shredded white chicken, avocado and onions.  The burrito was mojado (wet) slathered with red sauce and cheese.  Sounds amazing right?  Ugh, but bite after bite it's like they didn't season the meat or just think to throw a pinch of salt or pepper.  C'mon!  Beautifull shredded chicken can be flash fried with some cooked onions and some herbs!  Something must be done!  \n\nThis burrito was the definition of \"MEH\" - which I never really understood until having this.\n\nThat being said, it must be tried.  Just dump salsa all over it or hot sauce and you are good to go.  In fact, they have a PREGNANT BURRITO contest coming up soon...",

They've remodeled the place in Dec 09.\n\nAnd they've toned down their salsa, to my dismay. But I love their cheese enchiladas! Their nachos are great, the guacamole has a bit to be desired. They have negra modelo which goes great w/ any thing mexican food related. The service is good.\n\nThey know me by voice now, not sure if that's a good thing, lol. All in all, if you like hot salsa & a cozy environment, you should definitely check out this place when in the Palms/WLA area.",

I can honestly say that this is one of the the best restaurants offering real and delicious food from the Mexican state of Oaxaca. I have personally ordered all 6 of the moles they offer and all were beyond good. If mole isn't your thing then the I recommend Las Dos Gringas or the black bean enfrijolads.  Not the mention the beer selection is superb. I am a fan of their seasonal beers as they pair wonderfully with the food.",

Both were the two WORST burritos I've had in Los Angeles (and I've had a lot of burritos). I didn't even know a burrito could be so bland! The pregnant burrito was essentially a pound of poorly seasoned chicken wrapped in a tortilla and soaked in an inch-deep puddle of blah enchilada sauce. The veggie burrito consisted of two cups of black beans and a mound of shredded lettuce wrapped in a tortilla. There were a few token peppers and avocado slices if you dug around for a few minutes, but it was essentially tortilla, cheap lettuce, and black beans. Their burritos also don't come with any sides -- no sour cream, no guac, no pico de gallo, nada! Absolutely awful. Not to mention the staff was rude, and our order took over 45 minutes when they promised it would \"only be a few minutes.\" I'm legitimately shocked that anyone likes this place or that it's still in business. Do not waste $11 on a less-than-mediocre -- I'd go so far as to call it ABYSMAL -- burrito!",

So Honey's is kind of the \"anti- Kentucky Fried Chicken\" chicken.  This is good because it makes the chicken go good with all the available sides.\n\nNow the sides!  There's a large selection of sides available.  They include French fries, rice and gravy, mac and cheese, biscuits, and waffles!  I know I'm leaving out other sides.  (Sorry!)  I tried the french fries and rice with gravy.  They were both very good and was a good complement to the chicken.\n\nThere's warm honey for the biscuits and their own hot sauce. There's pie and ice cream for desert, and lemonade along with soft drinks.\n\nThe staff was friendly and courteous.  They keep the dining area clean.\n\nI definitely recommend trying Honey's fried chicken if you're near Culver City.\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool\nShayla W.\nBusiness Owner\n7/16/2018\nThanks for being a fan, Chris!

It was fantastic-moist not salty but a crunchy buttery textured piece of chicken regardless of the piece. We had wings-breast and legs and thighs all the same great taste. We brought the sides of macaroni salad and potato salad and coleslaw to round it off. Really a great finger licking dinner fall all. When in the area we surely will go back for this great product.\nIrwin Z",

But that is not the issue, because I get that sometimes the place is too busy. The problem is that all the workers behind the counter had a very arrogant attitude, acting like we, the customers, were bothering them. It wasn't just me, there were about a dozen other clients, and another dozen doordash drivers waiting for their extremely late orders. I even tried to ask one of the workers to talk to the manager, but the answer was \"she is on break now\", haha very convenient.\nAnyways, worst place to place a pick up order, and worst workers, all of them arrogants.",

Came to find a moderately long line but a (perhaps new?) sign near the register indicating to bypass the to-stay line for the pickup counter. Yelp quoted my order being ready at 6:52 p.m., and it was ready maybe 8 to 10 minutes after that time, but the wait wasn't unpleasant (next time I'll use it to start my stack of to-go containers of hot honey and hot sauce). The chicken didn't quite hold its crisp during the car ride home, but we threw it in the oven at 260 degrees and it actually crisped right back up (a surprising but happy outcome). The biscuits are just beneath Popeye's-level dry but you have hot honey (and hopefully butter) to remedy that. Seriously, once you put honey and hot sauce on that biscuit, you are SET. It's a truly delicious complement to the chicken (which I also drizzled with hot honey and hot sauce), alongside their sweet bread and butter pickles (maybe a little too sweet for me, but I have savory pickles at home), coleslaw, and mashed potatoes with gravy (the gravy was salty but addictive, and we appreciated the bits of chicken threaded within it).\n\nThe employees behind the counter were hustling, and if they were in the weeds, they were obviously working through it as best they could. The woman that helped me was fast but friendly and even honored the Yelp free ice cream scoop deal with pie purchase for my to-go order. They're not stingy on sauces (I asked for six sides of ranch dressing, she gave that and more), and I appreciate that even during the dinner rush, she took the time to make sure I had everything I ordered. Is this the best fried chicken in Los Angeles? No, but it's definitely the best in this part of town, more flavorful than Roscoe's (which I've always felt was overrated), and worth trying at least once in your life if fried chicken brings you unfiltered joy.",

It comes with fries, pickles, and a very delicious biscuit. We had a groupon that cost 20 and it's value is 30. Worth it 100%. I noticed over 2000 reviews here and only a 3 1/2 start average. If someone skipped over this Culver City gem because of that, it would be their loss. We typically stick to 4 star places. So I'm sure there are places the don't have a 4 average that are very worthy. This place is fantastic.\n3 piece lunch combo\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nShayla W.\nBusiness Owner\n8/4/2017\nHey there, Tim!

I ordered 4 pcs assuming that I would get the biscuits along with each piece, but apparently if you don't specify \"THIGH/LEG/BREAST + LEG\", they don't give you the bread bc it's considered a regular 4 pc meal. After we cleared that up, we still had to pay extra for the bread which didn't make any sense bc it's CHEAPER TO BUY THE CHICKEN+BREAD COMBO. GRRRR\n\nFRIED CHICKEN--NOT YOUR USUAL dry, battery skin but more CRUNCHY and OILY. The SKIN had a DARK COLOR which made me question if they were using old oil to cook the chicken in. However, the chicken was VERY TENDER and JUICY.\n\nBISCUIT--again, NOT YOUR USUAL biscuit. It's somewhat oily but the inside is SOFT, BUTTERY, AND SUBTLY SWEET. Apparently, it's a CORNBREAD + BISCUIT mix? I'm not a fan of cornbread but this I liked.\n\nLEMONADE--average.\n\nThe space is very casual and more like a FAST FOOD TYPE JOINT (order at the counter and seat yourselves). After our mix-up, the staff was very kind and understanding and gave us a free lemonade refill to makeup.\n\nI probably wouldn't come back bc this type of fried chicken isn't my cup of tea.",

A dash of hot sauce, sweet and sour and/or honey on their fried chicken or chicken strips makes for a fantastic meal. I would and continue to come back here again and again... in fact I try to limit myself to one or two visits every month. If I did not, I would be morbidly obese... hell I'd probably be dead.\n\nMy only issue about this place is parking, but it turns out there is a parking structure around the corner. Busy at times, and you have a hell of a time \"escaping\" around lunch or at dinner time, but hey, at least the parking is free for 2 hours!\nSign\nThe inside",

First sign we should have paid attention to was there wasn't a line out the door.\n\nWe ordered the family package, which came with fries, chicken, coleslaw and biscuits. There wasn't anything that we liked. There wasn't much flavor to the food. The wings were so small, with very little meat on them.It was a huge disappointment. KFC would have been a better choice. Their chicken and biscuits are better tasting than what is served there. The batter of the chicken, was strange, more like a tempura.

Came here off a recommendation from a co worker when we were discussing good fried chicken in L.A.. Mrs Knotts is still pretty bomb,  but that's way down in Buena park,  so this culver city establishment,  right in the heart of the hip culver city restaurant district,  is a good find. Chicken was very good,  fries average,  and biscuits were good. My co-worker raved about the biscuits but I found them only good. Bread and butter pickles make any southerner feel a little more at home.  Chicken is the star and it doesn't disappoint.  Just the right amount of crunch and still pretty juicy inside. I didn't find the seasoning to be overly salty as well. Will definitely visit again.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nShayla W.\nBusiness Owner\n10/26/2018\nWe're glad you came in to give us a try, Chris!

Usually I only order the dark meat, but the white meat here is cooked perfectly, tender and juicy. One more thing that make Honey's Kettle Fried Chicken is their biscuits. I don't normally eat biscuits but their biscuits, pair it up with their honey, is like a match made in heaven.\n4-piece Fried Chicken Dinner",

It comes with fries, a biscuit, sweet pickles, and your choice of 2 pcs of chicken. (I got the breast and thigh combo)\n\nMy friend Dave immediately was impressed by the coating on the fried chicken. It was crunchy, fatty, and oh so delicious. The skin was my favorite part of the meal. The breast meat was a bit dry but I doused it in hot sauce. The thigh was much tastier. Fries were ok- nothing to write home about. The biscuit was pretty good and I liked dipping it in the hot sauce.\n\nOverall, I was impressed by the coating of the fried chicken. It was unique and tasty. I usually avoid eating the skin but Honey's is irresistible.",

You simply can't go wrong with any food selection here.\n\nThey also offer pancakes, which are just as yummy!  I actually prefer their chicken and pancake combo to Roscoe's chicken and waffles.\n\nThe main reason they only get four stars instead of five is because their service is SLOW.  If you don't have much time, you may find yourself rushing if you visit here.  Every time I visit, I find myself waiting 10 - 15 minutes for my food -- regardless if it's 'for here' or 'to go'.\n\nThe other downside is they are a touch expensive.  It really depends on the meal, but just be prepared to bring a few extra bucks.\n\nIn conclusion: Great Food, Decent Price.  It's worth the wait...if you have the time.",

I note some improvements here and there like:\n\n*The serving area for the honey and hot sauce could be a little cleaner.\nOverall, the restaurant was neat and clean, tables included.\n*The chicken was just \"lukewarm,\" not piping hot as expected.\n*Advice: the green beans and mac 'n cheese could be served daily.\n*Noted that the fries were not overly salted--thank you!\n* A couple of unsavory looking characters ventured into the restaurant, then back out. (whew!)\n*Took a minute to figure out parking. Discovered that there is a parking garage near the back of the restaurant.\n*My dinner companion stated that the coleslaw was \"meh,\" so instead, ate halt of my macaroni salad.....lol!\n*\"A bit\" pricey, but the food was well cooked and not overly greasy. Not your typical chicken joint where the chicken sits under a heat lamp.\n*The biscuit and the honey complimented one another. Not a fan of hot sauce.\n\nOur survey says....!\n\nI'd patronize this restaurant again. It wasn't great, but it was okay.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nShayla W.\nBusiness Owner\n11/12/2016\nEpiphaney, we're thrilled you liked your first experience and have some valuable feedback as well. It's much appreciated to hear from you so we can continue to make our place more enjoyable. We hope your next visit will be even better than the last.\n",

This eatery made the best fried chicken in the WORLD!\nAlas this chain has gone the way of the Dodo bird (pun intended).\nToday we have 'Honey's Kettle'.\nJust 2 restaurants. One in Culver City.\n\nThis chicken is NO Golden Bird!\nAlthough, it's the closest to GB in taste, and texture.\n\nI ate there about a month ago, after a long hiatus. The pieces are much smaller than the ones they started with, and they have had the Gaul to raise their prices.\n\nI won't be eating at Honey's Kettle as often as I used to, but if you're looking for the best flavor in fried chicken, this is the place!\n\nThee is no parking next to the eatery, but a stone's throw away is a large parking structure.\n\nThey accept plastic, and if you are buying    More than food for two, call ahead and place your order. It usually takes 15 to 20 minutes beyond their estimate of when your order will be ready.\n\nEveryone within 25 miles needs to try this place out. If you can ignore the high prices, and the small pieces, I know you'll enjoy it.\n\nThen write your own review...",

I put up with the marginal customer service, cash only, sketchy neighborhood.\n\nHoney Kettle was okay.  I like calling to place my order first, but the girl that answered the phone wasn't friendly, there was no place to park, and the pieces of chicken (I ordered 2 breasts and wing and a biscuit) were small.  \n\nThis place is no further than my usual chicken spot and didn't cost any more.  I'd be willing to give it another chance as the food was good. Is it better than the OG up on 83rd and Western?\n\nNot really - -  but then again, I'm from the hood so I get it. To me they are on equal footing in terms of the food but won't be back unless its convenient.",

As a customer, I'm glad I used a groupon here as opposed to paying full price for my meal. Lesson learned.\n\nIn short, this place is overpriced. $9.25 for a 2 piece chicken meal (fries & biscuit, no drink). Now that I'm writing this, I just realized they forgot to give us our pickle chips that came with the groupon (for the record, they also forgot to give us the included coleslaw--I had to go back to ask for it--and it ended up sucking anyway).  \n\nIt's against my religion to eat fried chicken without gravy, so I ordered a side of gravy (gravy only, no mashed potatoes). It was basically a shot of gravy... for $2.\n\nThe chicken was ok. Not mindblowing, not bad. Very average actually.\n\nLemonade ($3) and biscuit (with honey) were the highlights.  \n\nSide note: They have one single-serving unisex restroom. I've seen truckstops and gas stations with much cleaner and more stocked facilities than this dump. No soap in the broken dispenser (one would think soap would be a popular item for a fried chicken restaurant), and the door doesn't lock.\n\nI don't understand how places like this stay in business.

I waited like for 20 mins till I finally got my food. And what do you think? They gave me not what I ordered. Plus another girl who worked in the back was extremely rude and with attitude and said that I had to wait 15 more minutes to get my order completely done. Wow! Seriously? I just wanna say it was my first and definitely last time at this place with horrible customer service.\nThe chicken was ok. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is that I got a refund. It deserves 0,5 star or 1",

There's potential for it to be great but when you're paying minimum wage to obviously bored employees, frying great friend chicken just isn't on their minds.\n\nThe fried chicken offered a good crunch, milder on the seasoning than I would have liked, but the chicken was cooked well and at the right temperature so as not to soak up too much oil.  The french fries needed to be double cooked, but instead they were single cooked, left unblanched and without a crispy texture.  It wasn't busy when I went, I highly recommend you go when it is crazy busy so that you'll know you're getting the chicken right out of the fryer.  I prefer Hot Dog on a Stick's lemonade to Honey's Kettle lemonade.  It was a bit pricey as the bill came out to $15 for an x-large lemonade, kettle fries, biscuit, breast, leg, thigh, and a wing.  If you're in the neighborhood, give it a try.",

You get that wonderful crunch as you sink your teeth into the savory chicken. It's fried and seasoned to near perfection! Dig deeper and you get the moist, tender meat that it's hard not to let the juices drip down the side of your mouth. Amazing! You also need to order their hotcakes!\n\nI can't give that much credit to their catfish and sides however. The batter on the catfish lacked texture. The fresh coleslaw was bland as it could have used more salt and pepper or better quality mayonnaise.  \n\nThe reviews that some people write about this place is a hard nut to crack. There IS a parking structure, and it's not the first tier choice for dessert so quit complaining.\n\nCome and get it!",

Don't get me started on the biscuits. I swear, I think they have crack in them because one or two biscuits weren't enough for me. They are piping hot when you get them, moist in the inside and crisp and buttery on the outside. Love them!\n\nAlot of people on here complained about the wait time. I guess we lucked out because we got our food in fair amount of time. However, they ran out of honey. How could a place with a name like Honey Kettle run out? Strange. Also, we ordered a supposedly warm peach pie, and it was cold. What a tease that was to take a bite into a pie thinking it was going to be freshly warm baked.\n\nDespite this minor setback, I very much enjoyed this place and can't wait to return!\n\nThe family meal seems to be the best value to get if you a party of 4.

It's not crumbly and heavy, it's more light and cake-like in texture.    \n\nWarm Honey - It's heavenly over the chicken and of course, the biscuits!\n\nWhat I didn't love:\n\nFried Chicken - It's golden brown and it's fried perfectly.  It's definitely picture perfect.  However, why is it cold!?!?!?!?  I swear I thought my mind was playing tricks on me so I fingered the chicken some more and yup, it's barely warm.  Oh well, I just poured hot sauce and honey all over it and ate it.  It was a bit dry and it wasn't impressive at all.  I could get better fried chicken closer to home.  I'm pretty sure it will be hot too.\n\nI won't be coming back.  It's not worth the drive.  That's too bad because I really liked the biscuits.",

I would appeal instead to the owner, and ask him perhaps to either have a better screening process for your employees, or pay them more, so people will actually want to come there, as there are a multitude of alternatives in the surrounding area. Perhaps even paying a dollar more an hour might keep your business from reaching fed up patron critical mass. Your product is really nothing more then average, but I might have the patience to walk in again if I did not have to deal with sub moronic employees and their uneducated disregard for customer service, texting and talking on cell phones while you sit rotting waiting for your unremarkable food. I remind you all that the metrolink disaster of a few weeks ago was caused by the same thing. I don't have to ride the chicken-link and my job or my life don't depend on Honey's Kettle Misery. Get it together, Otherwise , It was not really that nice having you, and I can't wait until you go out, and are replaced by ANY business that respects it's customer base. Please at least make an effort will ya? I doubt it, but I might be back",

I recommend having the lemonade with the chicken just to cut the grease. They have \"secret sauce\" and honey. Their secret sauce is like bbq mixed with tabasco. I had a biscuit too. Buttery goodness not on the flaky side though. I read the comment about the biscuit mix containing trans fat in it. I partly think its just the powdered mix they sell that has the trans fat in it (so it can last longer on the shelf).  We also shared a rootbeer float. Which was a yummy treat. =) On the other hand, the service did suck. Minus one star for that. They need at least one extra person to make the drinks. It just gets out of hand when the cashier is supposed to make the drinks and she's busy taking everyone's order. We got our food and was half done with it before we got our drinks!",

A friend loves to ask for the little crunchy pieces from the fryer ( we call them honey kettle crunch).

My friend kept going off about how awesome this place was, so I decided to bite the bullet and see what the big fuss was about.  It's nestled in Culver City right by the movie theater and in between all these cute restaurants and bars.  There is seating outside as well.  I ordered the most basic thing on the menu: the 2 piece with a biscuit and fries.  Now, I have a thing for biscuits but these biscuits were HUGE and melted in my mouth.  I took a bite, closed my eyes, and moaned. I mean, I took a moment to myself, a moment to thank my friend for bringing me here, and a moment of praise to the almighty Father in Heaven for inspiring whichever person it was who thought of this wonderful establishment.  The fries?  Golden and crispy.  The chicken?  I can't...I just can't.  Hot and crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside.  Sooooo motherlovin' good that it's making me wanna slap someone.  I WISH there was a place like this in the Bay area.  I couldn't even finish all my food and I'm pretty much a gluttonous pig.  The only drawback is that it's suspiciously pricey for a fried chicken joint.  True they also serve pancakes and other delicacies (I don't think pancakes are a delicacy but I think you see where I'm going with this) but for 2 of our orders, the total came out to a little over $20.  The combo didn't include drinks, but still.  A cheaper price would bump it up to 5 stars.  But I don't care.  I definitely plan to come back here again...and again...and again.",

I have been in there a half-dozen times since i live in Culver City but I have never been greeted with warmth and the food always takes a long time to prepare.

                  "review": "My friend hyped this place up for me and I was skeptical when she said it was the best chicken ever. Thats a bold statement to make, even bolder is that she said it was better then Churches chicken which I think is the absolute best. This place was in a nice area, the restaurant itself was very clean and I was quite surprised by that. There weren't many patrons upon our arrival but then again it was almost 930pm. My friend does the honors of ordering while I go to the restroom and clean myself up.  I admit I the food looked and smelled pretty awesome. I could feel my stomach growling. The food finally comes and instead of just grabbing a piece of chicken, I decide to get myself situated first and prepare all the sides on my plate. Usually, I would never do this but for some reason I felt like I had to do it. I grab my first thigh, examine it and determine that it looks good. A nice golden brown piece of chicken. I take my first bite and its good. Real good. This place is also known for their biscuits. I admit their pretty good as well. Dip them in the honey thats provided and their extra tasty. Overall, I would say this is a pretty good chicken place. A lot classier then other places. I would highly recommend this place. God I hope they open one up near me.",

                  "review": "Man, oh man!  How could I have gone so long without Honey's in my life?  You have to try the light-as-a-feather BUTTERmilk biscuits with honey.  They contain so much butter that the bottoms are almost carmelized.  Drip some honey over the top and you have yourself something closer to a dessert than a bread.  The fried chicken was crispy and tasty.  Actually, crispy is not the right word.  Crunchy!  Mmmmm!  The portion was sizeable, too.  Would have liked to try the fish, but they were out of it.  The thick-cut fries were sprinkled with seasoning so even they were unexpectedly tasty.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were groovy!  The groovy gravy was flavor-packed and had bits of celery, which was a bit unusual but it worked.  Also, the green beans were spiced just right and had chunks of potato in it.  The menu is pretty extensive and fairly priced.  Overall, this place was great...it's got to be at the top of the Fried Chicken Dinner list!",

After choosing a few places me and my friend decided on Honey Kettles. We thought it was really good but I of course had to pass it by my two harsher critics my best friend and girlfriend and it passed with flying colors. The server was extremely helpful in letting us put together a combo with the pieces of chicken in it that we wanted. We did extra biscuits instead of the sides. I live in Hollywood so I told my BFF to have a biscuit when it was fresh and we tore it up! We bought an 8 piece with 7 biscuits and I tried a pancake which was only ok to me. stick with the biscuits you won't be disappointed. We had to reheat it when we got home and it maintained it's freshness. We even reheated it again the next day. What can I say? It was slammin! I don't know what these other folks are talking about I already phoned home about Honey Kettles to my momma from the south who was extremely disappointed in Roscoe's. I told her \"momma, next time you come to LA I have a new chicken place that I think you will like.\"",

That wasn't the first time I encountered this kind of service from this establishment but it will be the last. The other establishments in the area were quite busy but not Honeys'. I don't think having poor customer service during a recession is a smart move but maybe they know something I don't know",

Oh yes I made a formal complaint to their corporate offices but they didn't seem to care either because I never heard back from them. The fried chicken wasn't all that (for some of the best fried chicken try CW Fish and Shrimp on Western and 65th Place) - the fried fish had a very fishy smell... EWWW... I will NEVER go back to this establishment ever again!",

I was recommended this place over a year ago by friends at Sony. Thought it was in the hood, but no, it's right next to The Filling Station and other $$$+ eateries. It was lunchtime and I walked past several of these places, some with lines. Walked into Honey's and there was only one other customer. Uh oh. Well, the chicken was okay--actually the meat was pretty good, but I didn't think the batter especially flavorful. What really took me out though was the restroom. Filthy. Disgusting. Had obviously not been cleaned for at least a few weeks. What served as toilet seat covers, toilet paper and paper towels? A pile of napkins (but thanks for this!). So the plumbing will go soon. Wow. Can't even get supplies. I let my friends know about the just okay chicken and the frightening restroom, they hadn't been there in awhile, now I know why.",

                  "review": "For years I have heard about Honey's Kettle Fried Chicken but never tried it.  When a Groupon offer appeared, I jumped right on it but waited until the promotional value had expired so I had $7 to spend (it is quite a ways from my home and work).  I ordered a 2-piece lunch, added a small cole slaw and substituted mashed potatoes for the fries that come with the meal and a lemonade.  First, they charged an extra $1 to substitute mashed potatoes for the fries which I thought was absolutely ridiculous.  The size of the cole slaw for the price and to be called a side was also ridiculous.  It came in what any other dining establishment would put salad dressing or tartar sauce in.  I must say the biscuit was very good and I would go back just for those.  The meal ended up costing me $8 additional dollars and considering that I had no dessert, a 2-piece meal with an extra side.....$15+ is too much for lunch.  I must say that I doubt I will ever patronize this establishment again.  I would likely get the biscuits but only if I am in the area.  I wouldn't drive out of my way for them as I have for food from other establishments.  My experience was disappointing.  I think if the prices were lower, you could swallow better but they are overpriced for the dining experience.  I did like the ambiance of the eat-in area so biscuits and ambiance is all that was appealing.",

The girl put me on hold, so I told my husband to head on over to get the order before they closed at 11pm.  They ended up leaving me on hold for 20 minutes. I texted my husband and told him that i would stay on hold til he got there so he could tell them to pick-up the phone to apologize at least.  He gets there and there are only 6 people in the restaurant.  He tells the manager and she asked the girl taking orders of she put anyone on hold.  The girl picks up the phone and says nothing to me and immediately hangs up with my husband standing right there.  Now he is yelling \" you just hung up on my wife\" , she lies and says \" nobody was on the phone\".  I call him on my cell and tell him that they just hung up.  He then sees the girl walk to the back laughing.  Needless to say the classless attitude and demeanor was just the tip of the iceberg.  The place was filthy,  trash all over there floor in the restaurant and behind the counter.  It is sad that the employees just don't care AT ALL about customer service or anything else obviously.  You guys SUCK!   Never going there ever again,  and will tell everyone that will listen to steer clear of this place as well!    And to the hispanic girl that hung up the phone.  ......  you!",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice-- very relaxing to chill with friends and the food was also very delicious. I personally did not encounter any rude servers when I went.\n\nThe frites in a basket had fries that were thinner than usual but that gave it extra crunch and tbh it was kind of fun to eat. The sweet potato fries were more thick cut and it was actually very crispy as well, not a single fry was soggy. The shrimp and grits had well-seasoned shrimp laid atop a creamy base topped with broad beans, onions, and peppers that gave it a perfect variety of flavors. The office burger was thicc n juicy surrounded by fluffy bread. Worth the hype.\n\nOnly reason I take away a star is that they were very stubborn about modifications and they didn't have ketchup. My friend was quite upset since it's her favorite condiment to eat with fries.\nSee all photos from Irene B. for Father's Office",

It's a good meal that should come with fries for the price.  But doesn't.... womp womp.\n\nFried Chicken Sandwich (15) is good for those who don't want the office burger because they already had it the week before.  Moist.  Good texture.  Solid win.\n\nSpicy Shrimp and Grits (18) is really good.  Too bad you get 5 spoons full of food.  Flavor is perfect with a good kick, but once you finish your plate in 3 minutes you're going to go back to the counter to order something else.  It's tragically small amount of grits, but good amount of shrimp... ish.\n\nSpanish Mushrooms (10) have you ever had a dish where you were like, okay.. i don't want this any more?  You have to share this with at least 2 other people.  You get tired of it pretty quickly.  \n\nSalt and Vinegar Tots (6) this is filler.  Don't get it unless you're still hungry and want to be comforted by something from the playground.  Won't blow your mind.  But when has tots ever?  I said what I said.\n\nFrites in a basket (7) - the shoe string fries are the best.  And actually a good portion.  It better be because it costs as a burger did in 2018.\n\nDuck Confit Salad (18) - my friend LOVES this... salad.... which comes with one duck leg.  It comforts him.\n\nThe vibe is super chill... like hang out with your favorite coworker chill, like catch up with a friend who loves Father's Office chill, like... hey parking isn't so bad lets meet up there chill.\n\nI was going to originally give it 4 stars, but considering how much I've been here I'm going to say.. it's \"great\" and that I'm just jaded because Father's Office is SO Los Angeles 2010. \"OMG... don't ask for ketchup and you can't customize\"  lawl.\n\nAnd zero service.   Same amount of attention you get at a coffee shop if not less.",

Folks line up to order inside the bar, order is then delivered to your table. The restroom was clean and nice decor. On to what you want to know:\n\nTHE FOOD: The burger. Flipping amazing! And please, understand, I am NO burger eater. I strongly. Strongly. Dislike red meat. But this burger right here! All the flavors combined was a little bit of heaven. Now, I did have to stop eating because I could taste the bacon (and agin, the meat was just too much for me), but I will highly recommended this burger for all red meat, bacon, and cheese eaters. Jaw dropping good.\nSalt and vinegar tater tots: I was mad suspicious but they were hella good! I will always have tots this way.\nThe curry something cauliflower was delicious as well. Not all soft and over cooked.\nThe fries in a basket were just that, fries in a basket. They weren't terrible but nothing special.\nThe AOILI SAAAAAUCE was everythaaaang! Next time I'm ordering a large side of that mess to go! I took a small side home, had it with some fried fish, myyy goood!",

The burger was hyped as one of the best burgers in LA and in my opinion, it did not disappoint. Apologies for the bad picture of it, I realized after I bit in that my originals were too blurry. Either way, it's not the most photogenic burger but it was fantastic. The caramelized onions, arugula , and cheese all balanced each other perfectly and the French roll and actual burger were great too. Would absolutely come back for this alone and I think it beats a lot of \"must try\" burgers in La.\n\nThe beet salad and the deviled eggs had a great presentation and were good but nothing super special. Keep in mind this place isn't a traditional restaurant , it's a bar and all drinks (refills too) and food is ordered at the bar.\n\nAltogether it was a good experience and I'm glad I finally got to try the Office Burger and would absolutely get it again if I was in the area and wanted a burger.",

On a Friday night all the outdoor seating was full, but indoor was all vacant, so we decided to grab the first available spot.\n\nLike many restaurant who are trying to go green, patrons would scan a QR code to access the menu. Once my friend and I decided we went up to the bar and ordered with the bartender on duty and paid after he entered the order. While my friend and I each ordered an entree, we decided to split each item so that we could see what we liked. We ordered the following\n\nFood\nThe Office Burger ($18): I can buy at least 4 double doubles at this price, but man the Office Burger is definitely worth the splurge. The caramelized onion has a nice sweet and salty jammy texture and the gruyere just melts so nicely on the patty. I ordered mine medium rare so it was very juicy. I also liked the   toasted bun. (5/5)\n\nNiman Ranch Pork Belly \"Al Pastor\" ($18): The pork belly is soft and tender, but it has a kick that gives your mouth a slow burn. I personally don't like spicy food so I didn't enjoy it. (3/5)\n\nFrites in a basket ($7) These are super thin french fries with a side of garlic aioli. I prefer thicker fries so these were just okay for me although I did like the sace (3/5)\n\nSummary\nOverall, the burger is the standout by a landslide. Get this and your golden.",

The food & drink is ordered inside at the bar and a short line. Customization of food isn't allowed. Originally my bf and I wanted to get the burger since it's known to be one of the best burgers in LA. However, it had blue cheese included which I can't eat so we opted for the fried chicken sandwich which was spicy and saucy. It tasted decent. The stout was good and so were the salt and vinegar tater tots. They had plenty of beers on tap and the cocktail menu is extensive. The hostess and server was very friendly. I would come back here for a casual night out.\nSalt and Vinegar tater tots & stout\nFried chicken sandwich",

Their burger, while not technically a burger, has been a staple LA sandwich for over a decade.    \nThe sweet potato fries are still the best in the business, no argument there.\nBut the burger... the burger has become something completely different.\nLike.. unrecognizable.  Aside from the fact that we ordered it/them medium rare and they arrived well done. We showed it to the server who understood and another one was promptly brought to us, ALSO well done. :)  \nBut that's not the main issue. The issue are the dry bun, the flavorless meat and the whole sandwich tasting all of a sudden generic and disjointed. Father's office burger is famous for being a whole perfectly calibrated experience. Where you don't know where the meat ends and the caramelized onions begin, where the arugula crunch and the bread crunch dance together to the same groove.  \nWe had three burgers, and they were all at gas stop on the freeway level.  \nI really hope they get their quality check back in line. It would be a pity to lose this spot.",

But it's got space, outdoor seating, and a ton of it.\n\nThe ordering process can be a bit funny.   You have to stand in line, order, get a number, then have lady luck on your side -- to get a table.  This can be stressful.  You battle other people for an available spot, it's not like the next person gets it.  Assuming you get a table, you can enjoy your craft brew in peace, and within a short while, your food gets delivered to you.\n\nWhy would you get anything but a burger?  Not me.  One of the amazing burgers out anywhere, served oblong on a French roll, With grilled onions, bacon, blue cheese and gruyere -- its fricken wonderful.  Fries are definitely worthy, but heed -- there is no ketchup.  Be forewarned!\n\nThe patio seating is very long, and great.

It will sell, and here's why: people love convention, with a twist.\n\nTherein lies the charm of Father's Office. This sleekly decorated, weirdly named restaurant undoubtedly has dozens of carbon copies within LA-- nay, within Culver City. But, a requirement to order at the bar and the tables styled after your Grandma's dining room add a refreshing take. Couple that with great appetizers and a tremendous beer list (who else carries Pliny the Elder?) and you're in the midst of an experience that borders on unique. In this city, how often can you say that?\nThe outdoor seating boasts large, beautifully finished tables.",

And that's exactly what we got.\n\nThis gastropub is located in a little plaza with several other shops that you can check out. FYI, if you're worried about parking there is a free valet to the left just as you enter the plaza.\n\nWhen we arrived for lunch we walked up to the doors, were handed or menus, and told that it was open seating. We chose to sit at one of the outdoor tables since it was a nice day to people watch. It is a bar style restaurant, where you need to go up and order your food along with your drinks. After which, you can wait patiently until someone brings your food out to your table.\n\nWe each ordered the Office Burger (caramelized onion, arugula, gruyere, and bacon) which was $13.50 for their self-named, huge and scrumptious burger. We also shared a side of sweet potato fries, which was $8 for a giant basket-- definitely good to share but quite pricey. There was also quite a large selection of beer, so you're bound to find more than one that you'll want to try.\n\nIf you want a good burger and cold beer in a laid back environment, this is the spot.\nThe Office Burger\nSweet potato fries",

We got there around 10:30pm and last call for food was at 11pm so I was lucky and stoked to get the full service of it all!\n\nLet me start with the ambiance of this restaurant/ bar. Everyone's ID must be checked prior to entering, so it felt very exclusive, but I liked it! As you enter, you grab your own menu and pick your own seats. You can pick between booths, bar tables, the bar, or regular (lower) tables- we chose the booth. The dim lights set an intimate mood, perfect for parties of 4 or less. You order at the bar so there is no rush to pick what you want to eat and drink. We did our research on Yelp prior to coming here (which I highly encourage) so we already knew what foods we wanted, but it took me quite a while to figure out what to drink because the drink menu was quite long!\n\nWe ordered the fathers office burger with fries and the bone marrow appetizer. I loved the fathers office burger! I think there was fig in it... Which gave it a sweet taste, but the cheese balanced it out. We ordered the meat medium rare and I suggest you do the same because it was melting-in-your-mouth good!! The fries were stringy thin, just how I love It. The bone marrow appetizer was not what I was expecting but it was AMAZING nonetheless. You basically get a small widdo spoon to scrape out the bone marrow and spread it on your bread. There is a pile of salt sprinkled on the side of the plate... Sprinkle that on top and its good to go!!!\n\nI recommend this place to every one (as long as you're 21)!! Eat AND drink to get the full experience of this one of a kind bar!",

                  "review": "1 photo\nSettle down children, Father's home. Now, I expect that you've prepared my Office exactly as I left it? No distracting televisions? Polished oak paneling? Eclectic fusion of European and American bar food? Rotating selection of 36 craft beers and \"forgotten\" cocktails? Absolutely no decoration? Good. Now, get along to your studies, and don't come back until you're 21.\n\nFather's Office is a pair of Los Angeles gastropubs designed by Chef Sang Yoon that immerse you in an atmosphere of stern modernity. The bartenders and chefs take pride in their serious business, and their dedication can clearly be appreciated if you are looking for a critically-acclaimed dining experience just outside of downtown Culver City. It's rare to see local drafts paired up with your papa's favorite old-timey cocktails like Hemingways and Sidecars on one menu. Some degree of strictness is understandable when one of the restaurant's major goals is high-quality cuisine, i.e., the lack of substitutions and limited variety of condiments and accoutrements. However, in either an accidental environmental after-effect or a dedication to theming, Father's rules are final in this mahogany man-cave. The bathrooms are labeled \"Sons\" and \"Daughters,\" in case you forget who is in charge, and any foreign food is forbidden in Father's domain, so best leave your co-worker's birthday cake at home. There's some fun to be had though! Some beer taps are shaped like staplers and paperclips! Please, contain your enthusiasm!\n\nBut none of that matters. Let's get to the fries!\n\nBoth \"frites\" that are available (remember, we're trying to class things up European-style in Father's Office) are served in a \"basket,\" though I'm not sure why the menu denotes the baskets in quotes. They look like normal fryer baskets, not waste paper poubelles, but it's still a stretch. The regular frites are served with a single cup of garlic parsley aioli for $6, and the sweet potato frites come with a roasted garlic and Cabrales Blue Cheese aioli for $8. Before you ask, there are no other sauces or condiments available except for additional aioli. I won't make a big deal of it, since Father's will is law, but they seem to hold #NoKetchup as a point of pride.\n\nThe regular frites come pouring out of a paper cone wedged into their basket. These shoestring fries are cut extremely thin and fairly small, but are able to be exponentially multiplied due to their size. Luckily Father's Office stuffs this $6 side pretty full, and it's definitely enough to take home for leftovers later. The whole bunch keeps itself heated from some hidden molten core, but not enough to burn. The flavor isn't very unique: salt and parsley evenly spread over each tiny fry. What's special about these shoestrings is how tough and crunchy they all are. The shells around each thin tater don't break up easily, which provides a crouton-like challenge to every bite. For the record, while the frites are mild in taste and satisfying in consistency, I found the aioli sour and an overwhelming taste when paired.\n\nThe sweet potato frites are traditionally cut rather than shoestrings (but wouldn't that be interesting?), yet are just as numerous and cut quite long, though maybe only by comparison. These frites keep their heat at a higher temperature  than the others, but the coating is the same mixture of salt and parsley. These frites have a more detectable taste too: a lingering sweetness that only reminds the taster of sugar if they think about it (like a Nilla Wafer). The shells of these frites are flaky and crisped like the main frites, but not as well done, however there's a soft flesh underneath. These frites pair well with their aioli: the blue cheese dip combines with the sweet frites for a lasting flavor that doesn't sharply overwhelm.\n\nEach frite has their own appeal, and both portions are large enough for sharing or leftovers, but their quality crispiness is not quite enough for me to justify the price and mid taste. Even though The Frequent Fryer doesn't review the restaurants themselves, the uptight aura of Father's Office is not one that I would willingly seek out for fries unless it was already convenient.\n\nFinal rating for frites in a \"basket\": 3.5/5 Spuds.\nFinal rating for sweet potato frites in a \"basket\": 3.5/5 Spuds.\nRating for frites in a \"basket\": 3.5/5 Spuds.

                  "review": "Look, the food here is good. There are a ton of beers to choose from. It's a gastropub, it's got some good gastronomy and it's kind of pub-like. But something's been bugging me about Father's Office for a long time. I couldn't put my finger on it. But I think I finally have.\n\nA little backstory: I mostly went off red meat years ago, when I was a broke stagehand and couldn't afford it and discovered to my surprise that I felt better. From then on I would eat a little red meat occasionally but I literally can't remember the last time I had a beef hamburger or a steak. It might have been during the Reagan Administration.\n\nBut I recently discovered I've developed some kind of dairy sensitivity, and can't eat cheese, so I've decided to reconsider my aversion to meat, since I have to eat *some* kind of protein. I thought I'd try one of L.A.'s best burgers and go from there. Father's Office is consistently rated one of those. My wife and I have been going there occasionally for a few years. Not often. She's gluten intolerant, so there aren't that many things for her to eat or drink. Now I have my own annoying dietary restriction, but I was ready to try the burger.\n\nI should note they have a peculiar seating method: No list, just hang around and grab a table when it's free. Which leads to a lot of people hovering around tables when they see someone who appears to be finishing up. We didn't feel comfortable doing that the last time we were there. This time we came a little early and got a table.\n\nProblem is, the Father's Office burger comes with cheese on it. And they do not alter or substitute. My wife can't get it because they won't serve it without a bun. I can't get it because I can't have the cheese. So no burgers for us. Someone else at the bar asked about that philosophy. The bartender said it wouldn't be the chef's vision. \"It wouldn't be as good,\" said the patron. \"Well, it would still be a good burger,\" said the bartender, \"but it wouldn't be HIS burger.\"\n\nOh.\n\nSo I got the duck confit salad, which was peculiar. The duck leg was served deep-fried; it didn't seem like duck confit, but maybe they confit it and then fry it to crisp up the skin, I dunno. I liked it ok, my wife didn't. We got a few other things that were gluten-free and dairy-free. She had the smoked eel, which we agreed is amazing. We got the mushroom and grits; it was kind of gross. \"Frites\" were good. I had a nice red ale, my wife had two kinds of hard ciders, both ok, not great. (No gluten-free beers.)\n\nBut it was the Smoky Bacon Bourbon Caramel Corn dessert that finally revealed what bugs me about Father's Office.\n\nIt's served in a CrackerJack-style cardboard box (\"Prize Inside\"!). It's got plenty of black pepper, and yes, the bacon is smoky. It was as advertised. But if you like caramel corn, you can get a better version on the snack rack at your local drugstore. As I was eating it, it hit me, like a diamond bullet: This is a place for people who want to feel sophisticated about their food more than they want to enjoy it. If you want to feel grown-up about your burger and your caramel corn, Father's Office is perfect for you. If you just want to eat and drink and enjoy yourself, well, maybe this is for you, maybe not.\n\nIt occurred to me in almost the same moment: Oh, Anthony Bourdain would have HATED this place, with the fussy beer descriptions and \"bottles from our beer cellar.\" I could be completely wrong, but a guy who said \"You know what kind of beer I like? I like cold beer,\" probably wouldn't have had much use for this place.\n\nSome places get few stars because they're consistently mediocre. Some places get few stars because they're uneven. This place gets two stars for being pretentious, without entirely living up to the pretensions. It's a burger and a pub, bud. Make people happy. Lighten up.",

There is seating inside as well, but it is dark and hard to hear other people talk over the music system.\n\nThe food was good--I got the burger and sweet potato fries. My burger was undercooked, which was disappointing because the flavors were great. The sweet potato fries were perfect and the aioli they were served with was amazing. The downside is that the food menu is really small.\n\nThe drink menu, however, is extensive, and this makes this seem more like a bar than a restaurant.\n\nOverall, it is a solid place to visit in Culver City. Another bonus is that they have parking!",

The first beer I ordered wasn't on tap till Monday, so I settled for the bartenders recommendation for a drake pale ale. I also got a Allagash White, and a Craftsman Heavenly Hef  (best hef on earth) imo.\n\nNow on to food. I got the FO Burger. The burger is really tasty, flavorful and just plain good. I also got the fries. It kinda sucks that there isn't ketchup, which I knew about already; so i didn't bother asking. I also got the cheese plate which I thought was pretty good as well.

Good parking and love the decor.\nOutside seating in the nice LA weather on a cute wooden patio and all wood inside bar style restaurant.\nLooks like a whiskey type bar so I ordered a grapefruit whiskey drink, I don't remember the name but it was definitely tasty and strong.\nOrdered the original fathers burger with grilled onions and sweet bbq sauce and delicious burger cooked perfectly. They wouldn't remove the onions but after getting my order I could see why since they were pre cooked with the sauce. Also ordered the sweet potato frites which were hot and crispy with a yummy mayo garlicy type sauce.\nThe food menu is unique but limited. The drink menu is extensive for whiskey and beer. Alittle overpriced in my eyes, but thats LA for you.\nThe bathrooms were also clean and clubstyle. If I am ever in the area again with friends would be a cool hangout spot.",

They also have sweet potato fries, and they are delicious.\nTheir beer selection is pretty good. I ordered the allagash curieux, which came in a large bottle ($32). I ordered one bottle to share with my buddies.  The burger was as delicious as I remember it. I didn't order fries this time, but the burger still tasted great alone.\nThis place is located in a shopping center in Culver City, and it has free valet parking. Just be sure to get your car before 11pm, otherwise you'll have to wait until the next day. Seating might be a pain in the neck if it is too crowded, I don't like their communal seating idea. I prefer to call in and be able to reserve a table, it will make things more convenient.\nI recommend trying out their signature burger, just get there a bit earlier than expected to grab some seating.",

Personally I thought the burgers were just ok for the following reasons:\n- only one burger to choose from\n- comes with onions ( I dislike onions)\n- didn't come with ketchup\n\nMy husband was very happy with the burger bc he loves onions and doesn't need ketchup.\n\nThe office burger positives:\n- quality of meat is amazing\n- cooked well\n- bun is perfect\n- cheese is perfect\n\nWe also ordered the cod fritter which was a little too fishy and Muschie for us, and the mushrooms were just ok nothing special. I feel like they needed something like toast or cilantro. Something to make it crispy or more colorful.\n\nWe found a seat pretty quickly but I wasn't a fan of sitting then getting up to order at the bar then having someone bring the food only to get up and pay when we're done. Too complicated.\n\nThey had a great beer and wine selection.\n\nI'm on the fence...\nMushrooms - Side dish\nCod Friiter",

This place is a bar so keep in mind you do have to be 21 and older to enter (they do card you at the entrance) It is also a chill place to grab a couple beers or wine and catch up with you friends.\n\nNow their food menu doesn't consist of much because everyone pretty much comes here for the Burger and beer. Their burger uses the highest quality ingredients in it. Keep in mind the burger only comes one way as in you cant add or take out things from the burger. The only thing you can control is how cooked you want your burger (medium rare, etc). Their beer selection is also quite big so enjoy trying all the beers to go with the burger!\n\nThe burger is about 12 dollars so it wont break your wallet. Just make sure you're 21 before you come get LA's best burger! Cheers!",

The Office Burger had a juicy meat patty. The grilled onions were sweet and smokey. Bun was fresh and soft, it got a bit soggy as the juices from the meat patty started to run down. Blue cheese and fresh baby spinach completes this burger.\n\nWe enjoyed the sweet potato fries but they weren't any different from other sweet potato fries out there. For $7, it's on the pricier side. Aioli on the side was also similar to others out there.\n\nIn conclusion, The Office Burger had a lot of flavor and is worth trying.\nSee all photos from Kimberly J. for Father's Office",

You can either grab a seat indoors or out on the patio. Since you order at the bar, the staff work very hard to cater to everyone and always seem overwhelmed. Parking is free valet.\n\nThey have a huge beer selection here. If you're not a beer person, no worries, they also have wine and cocktails on the menu.\n\nThe only food here that I always keep coming back to is the Office Burger and their fries.\n+The Office Burger: Medium cooked gives it a nice juicy component to it. It had caramelized onions, arugula, blue cheese and bacon. I'm not a fan of blue cheese, but it added another complementing flavor to this burger, which completes it. (I also don't think you can alter the way the chef makes the burger)\n+Fries: for just $2.50 more with the office burger. It's not too salty and goes perfectly with the aioli sauce. NOTE: they don't have ketchup here!\n-Spicy Stout Ribs: this is just average. A bit too sweet for my taste though.\n-Cheese plate: wasn't a fan of this...\n\nOverall, I enjoy their beer selection and tasty burger!\nCheese plate",

On this one occasion, I had come with a friend who had celiac and due to her medical condition could consume no gluten. We ordered a steak and had requested that the fries be put on a separate plate for sharing so to minimize any gluten cross contamination with the steak. The bartender taking the order said to her \"We can't do that.\" She said it's not because she's picky, but because she couldn't risk cross contamination with things from the fryer and asked if a special accommodation could be made. The response was still \"we won't put fries on a separate plate.\" We even asked if we could get the steak a la carte instead and we got a stern no.\n\nThis is far from an unreasonable request based upon a medical condition. It's rather appalling that staff would respond in such a way for such a minor request.\n\nI love the food and here, but that was an absolutely insensitive and absurd response. By principle, I can no longer spend my money here.",

They all liked it though and the taps look really cool.\n\nIn terms of customer service, even though it was super crowded, everyone was really welcoming and accommodating. Everyone who worked there seemed genuinely happy to work there; whether or not it was sincere, I'm not sure, but good job if it wasn't! I couldn't even tell!\n\nAll of my friends told me to get the The Office Burger because that's what they're known for and I have no regrets. Medium rare is the best way to get it and the meat was so tender. It doesn't even look like that big of a burger, but I got full after only a half, so I took the other half home to eat (and it was still great as a leftover!). I think it's because the patty itself is so large, which is great to know that you're getting quantity and quality for what you pay for since the burger is on the more expensive side.\n\nWe also split two sweet potato fries between 5 of us and it was more than enough to fill us all up in addition to our own burgers. The dip they serve with it is also delicious! And the best part is that if you run out of it, you can always ask for more! When we asked for more, they came back promptly with like 3 or 4 extra containers, talk about going above and beyond!\n\nLastly, the atmosphere is really hip and being there just makes you feel like it's THE place to be. And while it's obviously a trendy place, that means that it's that much more crowded. The lighting could be a little lighter because I could barely see my friend to the side of me, but I guess if that's the ambiance they're going for, you can't really say much. Can't wait to go back again!\nThe Office Burger",

A must try! Their fries are crispy and thin and the aioli for it is so addictive.\n-Lamb- served on a kebab and juicy. The sauce is very tasty.\n-Ricotta toast- toasted baguette with ricotta and some sort of sundried tomato sauce. Seasoned wonderfully. Light snack but satisfying.\n-Potatoes- Tasty, but steaming hot in chorizo sauce.\nMay pass on those next time but good to try. Very filling.\n\nWell priced food for the nice restaurant. Its straight forward with friendly staff. Love the patio seating. Strict on 21+ meaning no babies, too. can be busy, there is no happy hour which is disappointing.",

The duck was easy to cut through and melted in bites. The brussel sprouts were surprisingly good. We picked at every last leaf that fell. My boyfriend thought the burger was amazing and one of a kind. He loved the caramelized onions in the burger and the patty was super tasty.\n\nMy boyfriend and I vowed to come back here again.

The French fries were crispy and good with the aioli dip. However, they brought it out first and our burgers took a really long time to come out so we ended up eating most our fries before getting to eat it with our meal. The \"Office Burger\" is unique, flavorful but it seemed to me more of a sandwich more than a burger, with the type of bread and dressing they used. And I've never had a burger with arugula before!\n\nOverall, it was a nice one time experience and I got my burger craving out of the way, but it's not somewhere I'll be thinking about and it most definitely won't come up as a suggestion when the question of \"where should we eat today?\" comes up.",

You can see the perfectly pink meat oozing its glistening juices and oils, and soaking into the bun.  In one bite, you taste the salt and fat of beef, the bitterness and stank of gooey Gruyere, the sweetness of caramelized onion, the peppery freshness of arugula, and the buttery richness of the French roll.\n\nThe burger can be served with fries. These are no ordinary fries either. The thin shoestrings have more surface area per volume, so they get crispier and collect more flavor.  Dip them into the garlic aioli and you might forget your burger for a couple minutes.\n\nThe Father's Office offers a humble selection of beers and wine, with helpful descriptions.  I particularly enjoyed their pear-flavored fruity beer.  You can and must order your beer and food at the bar counter.\n\nMan, I hate to say it, but I do have one issue.  \nIt's self seating, so no one will help you scope for tables you prefer. You may just stand around competitively for 5-10 minutes or awkwardly stare down other customers to leave.\n\nHere we go with the tips.\nParking can be found around the block or valet.\nBe age 21+, you will be carded.\nI suggest outdoor seating where there are pretty lights, less blaring music, and heat lamps to make you feel toasty or roasted.\nKetchup doesn't exist in this dimension.\nBe basic and order the burger. Please. I beg you.\nThis speaks for itself.\nThe burger is clearly a no-brainer. Order and eat it.",

We have always loved the food.  We sat at the bar instead of a table.  From the moment we sat down, we felt racially profiled by two bartenders ( The bartender that closed us out was great and professional) My husband and I are both African American.\n\nThe first bartender (male bartender) motioned for another bartender to take our order. Once our drinks came, we just kept getting dirty looks from the female bartender who was asked to take our order. The first bartender ended up bringing us our drinks, but then we never saw the first two bartenders again.. they didn't leave. They chose not to serve us anymore.  \n\nOnce our food was served a third bartender began asking us if we needed help and providing us with decent service. Decent meaning.. treating us like regular customers and not being scared of us because we are African Americans.\n\nMy husband and I left feeling weird and uneasy because we gave the first two bartenders no reasons, to feel uncomfortable with our presence.\n\nIt's unfortunate because my husband and I own a food service business for the past 6 years. My husband has been a chef for 15 years .. we are well aware of what good service should look like.  Last night at Father's office was extremely disappointing. Except for the bartender that took over our tab.. he kept us there!",

I'd been to the Santa Monica location once, three years ago, and left satisfied but not quite impressed.  I had a better experience this time around, and I might not wait three years for my next Father's Office burger.\n\nThen again, I might - my fiance is a picky eater, and since he can't eat onions, he will never taste the Father's Office burger, which he would otherwise like quite a lot.  We could actually really use a default burger joint in this part of town, but because of the silly pretentious restrictions, we will never be able to eat here together.  A damn shame.\n\nBut you all know about the Office rules, so I'll get to the good parts.  When I came for lunch around noon on a Sunday, the restaurant and bar were almost empty.  It felt nice to be able to walk into a place this iconic and not face a wait.  The space was comfortable and cheerfully put together, and I loved the look of that bountiful bar.  There were dozens of beers on tap, and all the taps exhibited festive brewery handles.  Amy was running late, so Tracey and I made ourselves comfortable at the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful, and I ordered a Taps Irish Red, a beer I always order when it's available.  There were a lot of beers to choose from, though, and I'd like to come back to Father's Office if only just to drink.\n\nThe food, though, was pretty great.  I had The Office Burger with a side of frites, and it was somehow much better than my first one.  The burger was cooked a juicy medium rare, and the jam of caramelized onion and applewood bacon was full of flavor but not as overwhelming as I remembered.  The combination of gruyere and Maytag blue was creamy and pungent and lovely, and the arugula added a crunch of green to every bite.  I even liked the soft roll, which was still sturdy enough to carry the burger.  The frites were also fantastic, thin and crispy, but I can't say I didn't miss the ketchup.  The garlic parsley aioli is nice and all, but it's a substitute for mayo, and fries love ketchup.\n\nI doubt Father's Office stands out in the L.A. gastropub landscape as much as it did, say, five years ago.  That said, it offers a great beer selection and a damn good burger.  I'd go out of my way to go back.",

We managed to get a nice table on the patio - plenty of patio seating for a beautiful day.\n\nThe beer menu is rather extensive, but we settled on a nice bottle of red wine to go with our burgers. Everyone ordered the menu standard of burgers with shoestring fries. The sweet potato fries are great too, but more of something to share with the table rather than an entire side with your burger, as it does tend to get quite heavy. The burger was pretty decent, i had mine cooked medium well, as juicy and delicious as i have come to expect from a $15 burger.\n\nThis is a good place to come have lunch with friends, and a quality burger. I'd definitely consider coming back here again as it is close to my work.",

Hah.\n\nMy friends and I decided to make a detour on the way home for this joint since my friend has been raving about it. \"It's the best burger I've ever had\", he swears. Okay well, it didn't amaze me as much as I thought it would for 14 dollars, but it was still pretty good. I had this Office Burger. Great bite-- juicy, meaty medum-rare patty, delicious blend of cheeses, generous sprinkle of leafy greens, and CARAMELIZED ONIONS (mm do I have a weakness for that). It also comes with a massive amount of crispy, seasoned shoestring fries with some sort of herby white dipping sauce (this was bomb).\n\nLove the gastropub aspect of the place too-- it was easy to get drinks, friendly baristas, and tonsss of selections.\n\nA+ for free parking.\nRinds?\nOffice burger",

Besides the normal LA traffic, this location was pretty convenient and there was even a small lot we could park in for free. It was a tiny plaza with other stores so it was really cute. The venue was fairly big and felt like a classy burger joint with outdoor seating - perfect since it was summer when I went.\n\nMenu was very simple and I went with the Famous Office Burger. I am really picky with my burgers as in I order a cheeseburger with nothing but the cheese and hamburger...but I knew this was frowned upon here and for some reason, didn't want to fight it today.\n\nSurprise! I devoured the whole thing with everything in it and loved it! It was made very well - medium and full of balanced flavor. They had the right portion of everything and I was full in the end.",

My only qualm is that I was not nearly as excited about the place coming out as I was going in.  We got there early to avoid the lines, and everything was fine.  Paid, and while the bill was fairly high, I was excited for the FO experience.  I ordered the burger with a side of sweet potato fries and they arrived. Again, everything was fine.  The burger was juicy and the sweet potato fries were crispy. I ate everything -- yes, everything was fine.\n\nDespite everything being fine, I did not come out of FO with the same enthusiasm I usually have after a great meal.   While the burger was juicy and the bread fresh, I found that the presence of greens left a lot to the imagination, and it all sort of fell apart.  The SP fries were good, but reminded me of the kind you find at Cheesecake factory or even Trader Joe's.  This wouldn't be a problem, and this is not a dig; I love this type of SP fries.  I am just not willing to pay the price to have them delivered in a unique manner and with an aioli (which I did not particularly like or use).  \n\nBottom line: Food is good, but I do not think it was worth the drive to the Westside nor the price.",

                  "review": "Finally decided to try out a Father's Office burger.  It was a good burger, but not a life changing burger which I was hoping for. The burger is definitely delicious the first few bites.  The meat is great and you can tell it is Grade A.  The combo of blue cheese, gyurere, carmelized onions, greens, and special sauce are a hit!  The bun was good and fresh.  I knew coming into this, that there were no substitutions and that it comes as is.  I was really looking forward to the fries, but didn't like the dipping sauce that it came with.  I would suggest (tacky) bringing your own ketchup packets if you're a fries and ketchup kind of person.  The burger is really sticky (from the sauce), so you need to wash your hands on the way out.  It was a good burger, but I wouldn't come back again just for the burger.\n\nThe restaurant has a great layout, with a great outside patio area.  Half the tables in the sun, and half the tables out of the sun.  The music was too loud, but I think someone asked for it to be turned down.  This was of course when I was finishing up my meal.  The parking was great, but I did go on Easter Sunday so I guess it's not fare to comment.",

                  "review": "3 photos\n3.5 stars\n\nI have been wanting to try The Office Burger for a long time and finally got the chance recently.  \n\nLocation - I went to the second location of Father's Office which is located in Culver City because I was in Los Angeles on a Friday and the Culver City location was the only Father's Office location that was open at lunch on a Friday.  The original Santa Monica location does not open until 4 pm on Friday.  This location is in the refurbished Helm's Bakery buildings now called the Helm's Bakery District in which are located several restaurants, furniture stores and other various shops.  Helm's Bakery was very well known in the 1950's and 1960's for delivering baked goods in cool little delivery trucks straight to your door.  \n\nThe outside of the restaurant has a cool Father's Office sign and as you can see from my photo is right outside and below the main Helm's Bakery sign.  Just a side note.  If you get a chance, go to the furniture store next door to Father's Office called H.D. Buttercup.  It is one of the most amazing furniture stores that I have been in.  They also have one of the original Helm's Bakery delivery trucks inside with a little memorabilia from the Helm's Bakery.  I liked the inside of the restaurant with a huge bar and probably at least 40 beer taps.  You order from the counter/bar and then sit at the tables that are located inside and out.  There are a lot of tables.  But, they get taken quickly.  I arrived to the restaurant at around noon and it was packed.  A very popular place.\n\nFood -  I came to Father's Office for the burger.  But, the menu is quite creative and extensive with items like roasted bone marrow, crispy pork rinds, salt cod brandade fritters, and stuffed piquillo peppers.  \n\nI ordered \"The Office Burger\", which there has been a rave about, that came with caramelized onions, the menu advertised that it comes with bacon (but it did not), it did have a bacon and tomato compote (that did not taste like bacon but was tangy and good), gruyere cheese, may tag blue cheese, and arugula for $12.50, and you can order fries for an additional $2.50, which I did order.\n\nAs you can see from my photo, the burger is served on a slightly oblong bun, which is unusual but which shape did not detract from the burger.  I ordered the burger medium, instead of medium rare, because I heard from a friend that their medium rare is very rare.  Just a tip: when ordering any kind of meat from a restaurant, don't assume that medium rare or any level of cooking meat is consistent throughout restaurants.  It is not.  So, you need to ask any restaurant what their medium rare or any level of cooking or grilling is like.  The burger patty meat of the burger was delicious and juicy having a meaty taste in the center and a little charred/grilled taste (which was good) on the outside and edges.  There is no catsup, mustard or other condiments except for the bacon/tomato compote which tanginess and full flavor was a very good compliment to the rich, fattiness of the hamburger patty.  There was not a lot of cheese on the burger.  I could taste a little of the gruyere and not any of the blue cheese.  The arugula was a good compliment to the burger patty as well with its earthy flavors complimenting the rich flavor of the meat.  One thing that I would change about the burger was the bun.  It was not very fresh tasting and thus, did not really compliment the rest of the burger package.  I would serve the bun more fresh.  However, all in all, the burger was very good and it almost makes it to the list of my top favorite burgers.  I say almost.  Maybe it was the lack of freshness of the bun that blew it.  I don't think that I would call it a \"Destination Burger\".\n\nThe fries were not bad.  Thinly sliced, shoestring fries, crispy and they had a good fried, potatoey flavor which were served with a lemon aioli.  I have had better fries elsewhere.\n\nThe service was really good and helpful over the counter.",

Four Rose 11 year cask strength was intricate and complex while delivering a nice bite. Beer selection is excellent and enjoyed the bartenders suggestion.  The overall service was above average.\nVery strange to me was that I have never paid tax on drinks at a bar until I did here.  I was told it may be a Culver City thing.  Honestly the price/ quality ratio was fair enough that I would have rather just seen the prices listed higher and not known about the tax oddity.\nMay have lost a star because while I was checking in I put my phone in ketchup or something.",

Came here to try it once more, and turned away because we had a 3 month old with us in a stroller, \"SORRY, WE CAN NOT LET ANYONE IN UNDER 21\"...he is a newborn! How much booze can I possibly give my kid?  I understand that no under 21 is allowed, but is \"common sense\" out the door too? Is it really written on their policy that not even a newborn is allowed with their \"hungry\" parents because of baby's safety from drunk people, or have they turned away another group of customers because a \"stroller\" ruins the vibe of the place?\n\nIs it a caring restaurant or is it discrimination? Hmmm....seriously, I'm asking.\nUseful 1\nFunny 2\nCool",

My gal pal and I arrived for an early dinner on a weekday. She knew there was an open seating policy, so we were prepared to wait. However, it was much worse once we got inside. There is little to no standing room to wait, and the place was packed. The room was littered with couples and groups all waiting and watching for a spot to sit. It was like witnessing a pack of lions hunt a gazelle. I am not a fan of these kinds of situations. I should not have to compete to be seated in an establishment. Type of restaurants like these need hostesses for that very reason. It started me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Luckily, we happened to be standing at the bar just as two spots vacated- we pounced. Once seated, I dove into the menu.\n\nThe bartenders were friendly and prompt but were so overworked that no conversation was made at any point. My pal and I are big into craft beer and love the thrill of conversation about such while dining at gastropubs, we didn't get any here. We started with an appetizer and moved onto entrees. I was very satisfied with the food over all, but found the beer list lacking. When the burger arrived, I knew I was in for a treat. We halved it and I dove it. I rank it third best burger I have ever had. The combination of the Gorgonzola, onions, and the sweetness from the condiments was unreal. I gobbled my half down without even blinking. We both also shared the roasted baby blue potatoes, which were dressed in a garlic chili oil. The little blue babies were fork tender and the garlic was sticky and sweet. Next, we shared a dessert- which we both found completely disappointing.\n\nNormally, a 3 star experience wouldn't warrant a return for me, but I was so impressed with my burger, I am craving a second return.",

I love love love the fries.\n*I'm not the biggest burger fan, but I do like the combination of the french roll bun + carmelized onions + greens... Not the biggest blue cheese fan, though... and no subs = take it or leave it.\n*Plentiful seating (indoor/outdoor), though it can get crowded during typical times -- like weeknights after work, during big games (on TV), etc\n*Friendly, quick staff\n*This is so silly, but I love the design of the restrooms and how there is a common sink area for men/women so you can easily wash your hands without having to actually go into the restroom. Silly, but I like it.\n\nCONS\n*Parking can suck. Actually, parking and seating probably go hand in hand... when it's not busy, you can find both- but when it is....... you'll end up a block or two away on the street.\n*Non-burger menu is whatevs. I've tried the butterfish (w/ eggplant) but thought it was really underwhelming. If you're going to eat something, you should probably just get the burger.\n*The last two times we've gone, someone's ended up with an upset stomach. Weird, right?\n\nWe'll probably go back when someone's visiting LA and wants to try, but probably not just for the two of us... There are other burgers in LA that we like more!",

Fresh ingredients, everything about this burger was pretty good with probably the best patty I've ever had.

Leaning towards the sweeter side, the juicy burger is prepared medium just the way I like it. Top it with caramelized onions, arugula, cheese, and bacon - how can you go wrong? Also loving the baguette it's served on instead of your usual buns.\n\nThe bartenders were more than helpful recommending drinks based on your preference. Having to order from the bar is a little annoying however, in a bigger group, that's probably ideal. Sharing tables with others could easily be a bad thing but I love people - so it's all good in the hood.\n\nCasual with a tad of sophistication in the air - I'm digging you Father's Office.

I sent the hubby to ask people to scoot over outside (I didn't feel like schmoozing tonight) and I ordered dinner. This location works just like the one on Montana. Order at the bar, grab a number, and pray and hunt for a table. It's really ridiculous what we grown adults do for a fancy-ass burger and 100 (not really) different beers on tap.\n\nThe burgers were cooked incorrectly. I asked for mine medium well but it was cooked well the whole way through. My husband ordered medium and it was medium well. I just think this place isn't worth the trouble. The sweet potato fries are delish (.5 star ) but I can find comparable ones at Veggie Grill or The Counter.\n\nOh! I gave a star for the cool communal sinks. I love this..you can see everyone wallking out of the bathrooms and make sure they wash their hands!\n\nAnother star for the free parking lot. So much easier than Montana!\n\nThe last star for the name of their mobile Father's Office Truck (a la In N Out).. MOFO!!! I LOVE IT!\n\nSo all in all, go for the experience, just to say you tried the Burger Nazi's F.O. and then drive yourself over to??? Hmm... can't say I've found my favorite burger place in LA yet...",

I come here because I like the great selection of beers, and most of all the burger and sweet potato fries. I've had a few of their other dishes (most notably the ribs) and they are really great too, but the burger takes it for me.\n\nIf you like to customize, like ketchup, or don't like blue cheese, don't come here. Its not a burger place. Its a place for you to go, have a beer or two that you wouldn't normally have at a regular dive bar, and eat a burger that some top restaurants can't even say they can match in quality and taste.\n\nSure, the crowd is thick as smoke, there's people everywhere, you have to hover for a table, and its pretty hard to get a server's attention, but you should know all of this before you get there. No one get's off work and says, hey lets go to FO to get a drink. You just wouldn't want to deal with the people (although the new FO 2.0 manages that much better).\n\nBUT, if you want a perfectly seasoned, juicy and tender burger on soft bread with a side of crisp tasty sweet potato fries and an arrogant bastard or a great white pale ale to wash it down with, come here. Spend a few hours chatting with friends on a Wednesday night, and you'll get sucked into the allure that is FO.",

                  "review": "Ok, usually I try to restrict my reviews to being about the food, because I don't go somewhere if the food isn't good. But in this situation I have to make mention of the, um...seating arrangements.\n\nBased simply on the food, it'd be 5 stars. The Office Burger is definitely in the top three burgers I've ever eaten, despite it being $12. I don't know what it is, but between the damn well cooked beef, the cheese, or the cranberry (I'm assuming it's cranberry) sauce, something about all the ingredients together makes it a great burger. The sweet potato fries are also a must. I wish they still brought out them in the mini-shopping carts...those were fun. Still, at $7, I can't complain about the amount of fries I get. And if there's ever an opportunity to try to soft-shell crab, DO IT.\n\nThe beer selection is one of the best. There's so many options that you'd really have to go there to see it for yourself. Stuff you won't find at any restaurant, that's for sure. Unfortunately for you kids, they do check IDs at the door.\n\nNow the problem is...the seating. Unfortunately, and I really hate doing this, but this is what knocks one star off. To put it nicely, it's first-come, first-serve; to state it succinctly, it's a freaking free-for-all. Sometimes I'd get lucky and find a table in minutes. Other times I've had to wait damn near 30 min-1 hr for one, and that was was at 9 PM! It is what it is though...if you plan on bringing a big group, just make sure you stake your claim out quickly.",

We went in the early afternoon on a Saturday and even though it was a holiday weekend and the place was busy, we were able to find four seats at the bar no problem.  The staff were very nice, informative, and seemed to work well together to help everyone and get out the drinks and food quickly.\n\nThey have a fabulous beer selection and I, for one, am glad that they don't let children in their bar.  I understand that parents want to eat and drink just like us non-parents but if a place is licensed as a bar then I am glad that they follow the law.\n\nIn addition to the beers, we each got a burger and split two orders of the sweet potato fries.  Both were delicious and got unanimous approval from our group.  The best burger I have ever had? Probably not, but that amazing onion-bacon compote deliciousness definitely bumped it way up the list.  \n\nOne of the bartenders was happy to offer our friend a sample of one of the beers. This was after we had paid our bill so this just goes to show that they were just as helpful even when we were obviously not going to be buying anything else.\n\nI also have to give a shout out for the wonderful company.",

My first attempt at the Santa Monica location was derailed by a long line and a strategic misstep, but this time I would not be denied my burger, even if it was game 4 of the NBA finals!  Note: for those considering coming here for a game, I have on piece of advice.... DON'T.   There will be no place to sit and they only have two tiny TVs a the end of the bar.  \n\nNow for the goods stuff...I rate the burger between very good and excellent...I won't say it was the absolute best I've ever had, but it was big, meaty, and cooked perfectly.  The only area of improvement could have been the bun.  Regardless, the burger went phenomenally well with the uber hoppy IPA I adeptly indentified on the beer list (Drakes).  I also tried the pork belly, which was melt-in-your-mouth good.  Served in a bowl with greens, the fatty goodness sent me into a state of cholestoric euphoria.  A huge and varied collection of beers on tap plus insanely good burgers...I must say that FO gives Kuma's some serious competition.  Now all I need is a Father's Office in Chicago and my life would be complete!",

I had the pork belly. Not bad, well marinated, pork drowned in a tasty sauce. I sampled my friend's steak dish. Surprisingly, that was probably their best dish. The steak was tender and just melts as you chew away. Of course the sweet potato fries is a must. The food portions here are a little small, so you might want to order some sides. Also, absolutely no substitutions.\n\nThere's plenty of parking at this location. We arrived promptly at 7pm and were able to find a table inside for a party of six. By about 7:30-7:45 the place started to get real packed. It's first come, first serve. Find your own table however and wherever you can. By the time we were done with our meal, you can see people walking back and forth, scouting a place to sit.\n\nI recommend coming early and if possible come on a weekday. I was there on a Tuesday, I can only imagine how much of a pain in the arse the place gets on a weekend night.\n\nI heard a lot of hype and talk about Father's Office. It was a simple and decent experience. No complaints and nothing amazing. They do have a lot of beers on tap for you beer lovers out there. It's more of a beer-social drinking spot with a small menu to compliment your drink.",

First you order your food from the bar and then go to your seat where they bring it back to you, kinda like at Panera or Corner Bakery.  \n\nFood - The office burger is what i have everytime I go, cuz it's easy and it's good.  It's a gourmet burger, served w/ spinach and gorgonzola and it's pretty good.  I don't really have to add any other condiments to the burger, considering what an incredible ketchup lover I am(trust me, ask my friends, he he he).  \n\nPrice - I said it was a trendy spot to start, so be prepared to pay for your burger, your beer, and your sides.  Had 2 beers, a burger and an order of fries and my part of the bill came roughly to about $30.  The beers aren't ridiculously expensive, but they're not usually served in 16oz glasses, like at most bars.  But it's what I expected to pay at a place like this, so no ding on the $$$ from me.  \n\nOn a busy night this place can get crazy, esp on the weekends.  I try to come during the week if the boys are callin out an FO stop.  \n\nService - Ain't the greatest.  The bartenders can get a little short w/ you, and because you're ordering from the bar and your food gets dropped off at the table...not much comes your way as far as service is concerned.  However, I was there w/ a few friends a while back on a cold night sitting way out from the warmth of the heaters when a table opened up.  One of the staff members told us there were openings there and it was warmer, which was nice and unnecessary and totally made our day.  But don't expect much service...it's still a bar afterall =p\n\nParking - Again, great on the weekdays, pretty bad on the weekends.  Luckily my folks live nearby and we can all meet there and park cars and cp if ever necessary, but private lots all fill up when this place is rockin.  Plus you have the Jazz Cafe and all the other places around that compete for spots.  \n\nI've yelped before about this, but the resto on the corner, Beacon, has GREAT burgers too, and far less people crowding it up! :)",

The shoe-string fries and sweet potato fries are also a must. Both are great. Other plus is the easy parking, since they have their own lot in the back.\n\nSome other things to keep in mind. You can't customize the burger, you get what the menu says. The place is self-seating and you order food/drinks at the bar. If it's super busy, as it always is on a Friday or Saturday night, you might be better off grabbing a drink first and then waiting around for a table to open up...then make a beeline for it since there probably will be about 3 other groups eying that same table :P They also have outdoor seating with heated lamps, but the last couple tables at the end don't have heat so make sure to bundle up if you end up there.",

They come in a fair-sized cart, and are of perfect width. Being a person who likes skinnier fries, I thought they were still a good size and maintained their CRISPINESS (the most important part!) The office burger on the other hand was so underwhelming for me. I think my expectations were too high! I guess if I'm paying $12 for a burger I should expect heaven between two buns. I got purgatory.\n\nFor beers we got the Telegraph White Ale (recommended by the bartender when I asked for a very light beer) and I can't remember what it was called but it was the first under the \"Hoppy\" section (fruity and too bitter for me). They were okay, but my favorite beer is still good old Newcastle... the bartender's recommendation was a lot better than the one I selected for the 2nd round though! Listen to them... lol  \n\nI can see why people like this place. I liked the ambiance (minus people asking if we were going to be done anytime soon so they could POUNCE on our table) and the coupling/selection of beer, but next time I would just get the fries and beer.

                  "review": "This is my new favorite place to hang out late night and to take friends from out of town. All the bartenders are great, funny and knowledgeable, and they're always quick with a recommendation that really tastes good (or at least pleasantly different). The open seating really hasn't been a pain for me but I go on odd, non-weekend (besides sunday) days. The outdoor heaters are strong and I love the long finished wooden tables, and service is always fast and friendly. If I could request something it'd be for table water service (hey, it's kinda hard to stumble back inside sometimes), but that's really not that bad.\n\nNow, the food. I've yet to have something bad off this menu. They had been featuring a yellow curry mussels appetizer ($15) that was so comforting in its tastiness: clean, but briny flavors. Everyone raves about the burger ($12) and it's true - I'm particularly in love with the texture of the patty, which is almost as finely ground as meatloaf. My new favorite find is the duck confit salad ($14, i think), which is the first time I've ever had figs, with a lovely tangelo vinaigrette. I paired it with a sweet wine beer last time from Pasadena and it cut the duck fat well.\n\nSummer is coming and I can't wait to kick back and have some more great nights here. 21+ to eat here and it's easy enough to park... plus it's about a half mile away from a Scoops.\n\nps. has anyone seen the Helms bakery? what am i missing?

People drive kind of crazy here!\n\nAMBIANCE: It was definitely not what I expected! It's not the old school rustic smokey feel that I would associate with a father's office, but instead, it's modern and kind of woodsy (if that makes sense!). There were a ton of people there for a Monday night. The lighting was on the dark side but not ridiculous Hollister dark.\n\nFOOD: I ordered the burger (of course!), a side of sweet potato fries, and a beer similar to Blue Moon that I was never told the name of. :( I guess their beer selection is way too extensive to include Blue Moon, so the server kindly offered me a similar selection. Upon ordering, I told the waiter our general seating area (free seating in a crowded restaurant is so difficult!). The food came out so quickly! Within 10 minutes, everything was out on our table, and my friends and I were feasting. :) Nomnom!\n\nThe burger was cooked to our liking (a bit too medium rare for  our medium request, but that's cool). I loved how they stuffed veggies in it to make it \"healthy\". Yeah right FO, I know exactly what I'm getting myself into! The SPFs were on point and came with a side of blue cheese aioli. My friend requested their garlic aioli, and it was delicious!\n\nMISC: There were a TON of couples here for some reason! Cute date place :)\n\nI would definitely come again, but I want to check out their SM location first.",

I have been to this location a couple times before but I know there is also one in Santa Monica which I believe is much smaller because the times we've tried to eat here it was way too packed and there was always a wait. Bf was able to eat at the SM location once but they had to do it standing.\n\nI've only ordered the burger here but I really should try the bone marrow once since I love me some artery clogging marrow!\n\nFO good to try, but not sure if I'd drive super far to try them, if in the area then maybe I'll make a stop.",

This place serves legit burgers. This place is pretty much the place that started the whole gourmet hamburger scene. If you want to try the original and possibly still the best, come here on a Friday night or weekend afternoon. Also for some reason there are always attractive girls here.\n\nThe craft beer selection is pretty good too. Great way to spend an afternoon. Chat with friends, have a nice beer and a delicious burger. Then you can go furniture shopping drunk with your girlfriend next door and comment on how expensive all the furniture is.",

Negative on their website..doesn't really tell you what they serve..)\n1) Duck salad (3.5/5)\n2) Burger (2.5/5)\n3) Roasted bone (3/5): this dish takes a while so if you're hungry you should prob order something else\n4) Potato fries (3.5/5)\n\nWe ordered a few drinks, but I can't remember what they were called. All delicious, nonetheless.\n\nOverall, great first time experience, but prob wont be back. Pricey, and I don't think the food justified the price. I think it came out to be about $25-30/person.",

Got there a little before noon and and was second in line.  We came in grabbed a table, and headed straight for the bar because we knew exactly what we wanted.  Beet salad, FO burger, ribs, deep fried soft shelled crab, and sweet potato and regular fries.  I could not be more excited.  \n\nService was awesome. The staff was super friendly and got out everthing super quick.  The beet salad was great--i just love the vinagrette.  The fries--don't we already know how great they are?  Sweet potato fries were crispy, yet perfectly tender.  The shoestring fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly.   I just loved the soft shelled crab--served with a corn relish with thai basil and lightly dressed in a vietnamese chili sauce.  D-I-V-I-N-E.  I could have easily devoured another.  My brother and sister went for the ribs. I had a piece and while I thought it was tasty,  I don't think I'd ever order it again.  The meat was tender and done very well, but I wasn't too fond of how heavy the molasses/beer sauce was.  Either way, everyone else at the table enjoyed them.  \n\nOkay, the burger deserves it's own paragraph.  Medium rare patty, carmelized onions, and cheese, over a bed of arugala on a perfectly chewy and soft bun.  I can't tell you how sad I was when I finished that burger.  The FO burger is out of this world!  I wonder if I can convince the bf to make another stop before our Vegas trip this weekend...Yes, my friends--it's that good.  It's $12, but it's goooooooooooooooodddd.  \n\nOh and they have great beer on tap.  I had Craftsman's Orange grove--and it was delish.  I'm also a huge fan of their martini.",

Let's face it - at work, I don't have food service (well... the delivery around the office isn't as good as F.O.) and my liquor, beer, and wine selection is limited to what's in my desk or the office fridge for the day.\n\nMy friend and I met for dinner early on Saturday night. The parking is free (yay) and F.O. shares its lots with a handful of furniture stores and 2 or 3 other food joints. It was about 6:30pm, and we were lucky enough to snag a table outside on the patio after ordering. There is an amazing selection of beer and wine on tap, including a rather satisfying white wine from one of the Santa Ynez wineries. My friend got a stout beer that tasted familiarly of chocolate, but I can't seem to remember the name of it.\n\nWe started off with the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer, which came with 4 perfectly cooked shrimp. It didn't taste like anything special, but can you really go wrong with bacon-wrapped shrimp? We continued with some mind-blowing beef bone marrow served with toast points. It was my friend's first time having bone marrow, which I insisted on ordering since I've been craving it for a time, and I'm pretty sure that I've converted him!\n\nFor our main course, we absolutely had to split The Office Burger - medium-rare dry aged beef, caramelized onion, applewood bacon compote, gruyere, matag blue cheese and arugula on a heavenly bun. Yum! Blood red in the center, the thick beef patty and its toppings makes my top 5 burgers list. We tossed in a side of amazing shoestring fries for $2.50 more, and I was more stuffed than a Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nI would definitely recommend F.O. for friend outings, dates, or what-have-you. 21+ only. They card even in broad daylight.",

The burger is the star of the show, and it's quite good. They do a good job keeping the meat very tender and juicy, and it's coated with tasty carmelized onions and a glaze that's got a hint of sweetness and nice umami to it. Add in the pepperiness of the greens and creaminess of the cheese, and you have a winner. I don't consider it the best burger that I've ever had, but it's definitely a good gourmet burger.\n\nCouple things bring this place down. The fries are the skinny shoestrings. Not that I don't like those, but they're not my favorite cut. That and the fact that they don't give you ketchup here. Great. I like my ketchup with my fries and burger. I think it tastes good. If some people think that's equivalent to ruining a burger and fries, then I'm perfectly fine with ruining my food.\n\nSecond, price. This place gets pricy really fast. If you have a drink to go with your food, you're dropping $20-30 easily. That's an expensive price tag for some bar food, albeit gourmet bar food. The portion sizes are not amazing either, so you might be leaving wanting more.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the taste of the food and beer selection get 5 stars whereas the bang for buck factor gets 3 stars, which averages out to 4.\n\nOh. And another thing. This location has way more seating and is way more accessible than the original Santa Monica location. I'd come here just for those reasons, even if I was closer to the other location.",

                  "review": "7 photos\nThis is one of the restaurant that has been under my \"bookmarks\" for the longest time because of its 500+ reviews!\n\nI went on a Tuesday night but wow...it was crowded =) There are very limited seating at Father's Office so everyone just kind of stands around which is nice in a way - casual, relaxing, and friendly. There are no hostess or waiters, you pretty much just stand around until someone leaves to seat yourselves. The room was dark with minimum music playing in the background, very cool and lay-back socializing hot spot.\n\nWow and the beer, I wonder how many times I'll have to come in order to try everything to decide what I like LOL There are just too many to choose from! Since I'm not a beer expert or a brewing master (I like to drink it tho!), I pretty much just did the eni meeni mini mo and picked. But don't worry, if that's too risky for you, just ask the bartenders. Lots of plus points for the bartenders, they are all really friendly and helpful!\n\nOkay so our food comes, mmm... yes, agree with all other yelpers, sweet potato fries, YUMMY! (Remember NOT to ask for ketchup, there are no ketchup in the restaurant, they serve their fries with a creamy tartar sauce-ish condiment, VERY GOOD THO!) Everything was pretty good (not great). Overall, I give the restaurant 3 stars because it is a little bit over priced (drinks tho, not the food). Beers are around $10 a glass and wine is about $12-13 per glass, yah, so a couple of rounds for two, you're talking about $50 at least (just on drinks).\n\nI had high expectations for Father's Office because of all the reviews on Yelp (don't get me wrong, it's a good place, there's just nothing I would crave during any given moment). I wonder if I'd have had a better experience if it wasn't for yelp LOL Has yelp starting to un-do my search and experiences for great food instead of helping? haha... nah, next! I'm onto the next great search on yelp.\nSee all photos from Cindy C. for Father's Office",

I was told by them that the burger there seemed \"dank\" so my eyes, and stomach, were set on testing this theory. I believe this place is a 21+ only, so no bringing the kids around to sample the fare. Entering you get your id checked by a bouncer and have the option of dining at the bar, within the building or the patio. There is a very dingy, dark and moody vibe that I am completely digging. A nice place to hang out in the patio and joke with friends over their wide variety of enticing beers.  A huge issue is the first come first serve seating where couples will occupy large booths without the concern for others.... Not cool. But after thirty minutes my group of six was able to seat. You must order at the bar as well, which is a huge hassle especially due to the fact the bartenders or not only taking orders from the cash register and customers at the bar, but also pouring beers and samples. The wait can take a while anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes depending on how busy.\n\nI ordered the highly acclaimed burger with a side of frites along with this interesting fruiting concoction beer called _____Fruitesse. The burger was juicy and succulent dripping with its meaty goodness. Atop was a jam of caramelized onions both sweet and tangy, with bacon and arugula. The bread was a soft French roll with thin frites dusted with salt and an aioli of sorts I'm assuming may have some garlic and lemon notes. The burger was huge, bigger than most burgers. I would have aimed for less of the onions due to their pungent flavor and less salt on the fries. My friend ordered the patatas bravas -roasted potatoes served with a chorizo sofrito and goat cheese which was incredibly delicious. I wish they would just give you more!\n\nA great place to visit and hang out grab some well seasoned, well flavored dishes to accompany the good booze and friends. Definitely would come here again to sample some more of their dishes.\nPatatas Bravas - so insanely mouthwatering! MUST TRY!!!\nThe acclaimed Office burger with a side of frites accompanied by a dipping sauce.",

                  "review": "NOPE.\n\nOk, I'd give them an extra half star if I could. But I can't, so tough cookies. Here are my feelings on Father's Office, in a handy list format:\n\n1 - Ordering at the bar is the WORST. It's not the bartenders' faults - they're swamped, they're on their toes, and the customers are grumpy. I get that. But it is so obviously a terrible system, why not change it? Don't keep the bad system because you're trying to be all cool and hipster. Get a waitstaff, PLEASE. I brought a friend here from out of town, and even though we arrived 15 minutes after lunch had started on a Saturday the place was swamped. We had to shout at a bartender to order, then awkwardly hover over an occupied table for 15 minutes until its residents departed. Makes for a terrible and stressful eating experience.\n\n2 - Price. I have eaten my share of fancy burgers. I used to work at a fancy burger joint. This burger ain't worth the price. And the fries are not good enough to warrant an $8 price tag.\n\n3 - The Burger. I was so excited to try this place, even though I'd been warned against it. But I was literally shocked by the mediocrity of the burger. Sure, the combination of toppings was good, but the burger itself was not as good as the ones I make at home. It was soggy and had zero flavor. All the flavor in the burger came from the strong cheese, bacon, and arugula combination. For the price you'd expect them to use steak trimmings to make the burger, but it tasted like 80/20 ground beef to me. Unseasoned ground beef at that.\n\n4 - The ketchup thing. It's douchey for the sake of douchey-ness. Stop it.\n\nI don't drink beer, so maybe I missed out on what helps most people keep a rosy perspective while eating here, but I should still be able to enjoy the burger sober. Sorry FO. I won't be back.",

I do like that it's easy to find parking and that there is a much larger space for seating inside and outside.\n\nGet ready to become cozy with your neighbors when sitting at the tables outside, especially. That is, unless your party can occupy the whole table. I'm not sure if it's like this during lunch time (I'm guessing no), but I'm pretty sure evenings are always busy. There are space heaters under the roof, for the tables that are covered which helps it from getting too cold outside.\n\nI've had the office burger w/ the shoe string fries both times I've come here. Overall, I have to say that the burger at this location is not as good as the Santa Monica location. I can't quite pinpoint exactly what it is, but it's different. However, it still remains one of the best burgers I've eaten. One of my friends got a lamb dish. I don't remember what exactly it's called, but it was just lamb on a skewer. It was quite tender and tasty, but a small appetizer IMO, not a meal.\n\nService at the bar is pretty good, all things considered. The bartenders are all nice and knowledgeable. I told the guy what I liked and asked for recommendations. Good choices overall.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back to this location. Parking is better and lots more seating space.\n04.24.09 - lamb\n04.24.09 - office burger + fries",

We had to leave by 8:30ish before we got stabbed by someone...\nWe had our little corner spot in the backroom...and was asked by at least 3 different people to leave soon ... The place gets PACKED after 7pm.\n\nJust avoid getting there around 7:30-8:30ish... you will be miserable moshing with people.\nAlso, avoid playing cards or board games there... you may be chased down by vicious angry people carrying their beers on one hand and burgers on the other.\n\nAnyhow skipping to the review section,\nThey have unbelievable selections of beers here...of course...\nAnd me being the un-cool baby of the group...had bubbleup! And pretended like it was a beer bottle....\nBut everyone pointed out that it looked like one of those illegally imported Mexican sodas...in any case, I didn't care since it was delicious!\n\nUnfortunately, we were not able to have our fries in super mini shopping cart since people have been stealing them...\nBut geez, their sweet potato fries really Kicks A$$.\n\nAnd of course, the burger... after totally K.O-ing the all the greasy unbelievably yummy fries...we all finished the burgers as well. They have very different kinds of burger from the Counter (especially the fact that you gotta eat what you get, no selection).\n\nTheir wine selection isn't bad either...just incase you have those high class snobs in your group who cannot drink beer.\nGreat place, but really packed.\n\nOverall, this place certainly is not overrated, and though they don't have happy hours, the price is very reasonable.\nPlenty of parking...if you arrive early and that is...\"IF\" you get there early...\n\nThere are so many, just make sure to know what kind of beer you like, and ask the bartender what they would suggests that tastes similar  they will give you great suggestions.\n\nHappy \"Beer\" selection =)\nSee all photos from Kwiri Y. for Father's Office",

The medium rare is delicious but on my last visit, I discovered that rare is definitely where it's at. Beautiful sear on the outside, perfectly red and meaty on the inside. Love it. The frites are wonderfully thin and crispy and go perfectly with the garlic aioli. Plus, they have Lindemann's peche lambic on tap. How cool is that? It tastes so much better (read: less syrupy) than bottled.\n\nAnd I just had to try their latest menu addition: DESSERTS! Oh my gosh - the ice cream sandwich is so good. Do it. It's hazelnut / foie gras ice cream smooshed between two cinnamon-y oatmeal raisin cookies. Amazing. The foie gras flavor is really delicate but it's there. Unfortunately the sweetness of the cookies overwhelms it quite a bit. Sadness. But still, everything is made in-house!\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\n10/29/2010Previous review\nSo I discovered the secret to avoiding the crowds and awkward waiting: bail out of work early, pick up your significant other, and speed down the block before anyone else gets off work.\n\nSeriously though, we got there around 5:45pm and while the place was pretty bumpin', it wasn't packed. We even managed to snag a huge booth just for the two of us (douche-y move, I know). The guys (and gals) behind the counter are friendly and helpful... beer sommeliers, if you will. They picked out a great ale for Martin M, and I'm sure they would've made a fine selection for me if I were drinking that night.\n\nWe ordered a Father's Office Burger each, med-rare, and split an order of frites (half off if you order it with a burger!). Honestly, it wasn't the best burger in LA to me. It was more like a really really really good hot sandwich. Still a very enjoyable experience: the sweet caramelized onion, the not-too-strong gruyere, the arugula for greens, and the patty - it's thick and juicy and cooked perfectly to temperature. But what really stole the show were the frites! I know everyone talks about the sweet potato frites (which I still wish I tried - will return for that!), but the regular frites deserve some credit too. Super thin cuts fried to a crispy crunch, sprinkled with parsley and salt, dipped in a garlic parsley aioli that's just oozing with garlicky goodness. I'm pretty sure I ate more than my half of the order, but Martin was nice about it.",

I happened to be craving red meat and the burger did its job. The cheese, argula, were great accompaniments to the patty while the Worcester sauce? sealed the deal. The sweet potato fries were good as well but I'm not quite sure whether they lived up to all the ravishing reviews on here.\n\nI would come again if someone else suggested it but I probably wouldn't make it a point to introduce it to others. If there is a next time, I'd want to try the other things on the menu.\n\nP.s. They don't serve ketchup here, which I thought was thoroughly strange.",

I come here quite often to get a basket of fries and a beer with my friends and co-workers after a long week. From all the times I have been to F.O. I have never made a new friend or had any type of conversation with anyone else other than my own friends in that place. People act a bit stuck up and sometimes rude. They keep to their own group of friends & even though I've been here plenty of times, the staff never seem to remember us... maybe they are too cool.  \n\nThe variety of beer on tap is amazing. The fries and dip are addicting & have a good flavor. The staff is okay. Some are more helpful than others but it doesn't get any better than just okay service. It is pretty expensive so I recommend you grab one delicious beer  then go somewhere else to have fun.  It gets very crowded and loud around 6- 7 p.m. anyway.\n\nIt helps that there is always free parking so don't ever feel forced to stay for too long.",

The Office Burger by itself is reason enough. Delicious, a little sweet, perfectly cooked, and a true testament to what a gourmet hamburger should taste like. Just don't expect to make any substitutions because that is expressly forbidden at this place (don't worry, you won't need them).\n\nIf the food wasn't reason enough to frequent this place, the ever changing selection of beers will keep you coming back. Everything, including the food, is order at the bar though so you might need to squeeze your way between other patrons to get the attention of the bartender. Usually, that isn't a problem, though, finding a table often is so get there early or play the awkward hover game.\n\nAll in all this place is an outstanding, reasonably priced, delicious experience but it gets dinged a star because the menu is really short and doesn't offer much variety.",

Perfectly cooked, with excellent caramelized onions, bitter greens, a duo of funky, runny cheeses, and an epic bun, the Office Burger is probably the best I have personally had in LA.\n\nThe sweet potato fries are also bonkers, maybe due to the wildly good garlic aioli they serve with it. The brussels sprouts with pine nut dish here was good but not great. Maybe I just felt that way because the burgers and sweet potato fries were so good. The selection of beer here is also excellent and you can tell the staff are working hard to keep up with the torrent of people rolling through this spot.\n\nAlso, the desserts are sick. Both a date toffee pudding drenched in caramel and a super fun Root Beer Float Ice Cream Bar were mind-blowingly good. The poprocks coating the exterior of the ice cream bar and the granita of root beer flavor mixed with vanilla ice cream was great.\n\nBut yeah, the burger is the best. It was so good.

The pretentious \"no alterations\" policy is enough to make me never want to go back; I have a dairy intolerance and asked for no cheese on my burger, and they refused. I wasn't asking for a substitute, just simply to leave the cheese off. No dice. Apparently someone is taking himself way too seriously by enforcing such a draconian policy for what's little more than a patty of ground beef and some bread.\n\nSince I can't have the burger, I've sampled many other menu items... the menu is limited and everything I've had has been forgettable.",

Here's my take on it.\n\nOffice Burger:\nTop-notch burger when it comes to uniqueness.  It's not your typical lettuce, tomato, meat, and cheese burger.  It doesn't even resemble a burger, more of a sandwich.  It's on a french roll topped with arugula, carmelized onions, and blue cheese (?).  The meat is tender, almost a crumbly consistancy but very well seasoned.  The onions give the burger a sweet flavor while the cheese is perfectly gooey and melted.  The arugula adds a nice bite to the burger.\n\nSweet potato fries:\nOMG these were SO DELICIOUS.  They were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and sweet on the inside.  I couldn't get enough of the aioli dipping sauce.  These were the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.\n\nIt's hard to rate this as the best burger ever because it really depends on what you consider to be a burger.  This one was definitely delicious but different.  Don't tell anyone but I put the sweet potato fries in my burger and it was great!  I felt like I was offending them by doing that since you can't even ask for ketchup.\nOffice burger, look at all that arugula!\nsweet potato fries and beer!",

They always seem to cook there patty just right, but the whole thing reaches elite status when you pair it with their caramelized onions and Gruyere cheese.\n\nBecause I always arrive with such a big appetite, I always tend to order more than I can actually eat, so my one pro tip for first-time visitors would be to share the burger plus fries with someone else and it's more than enough food. I understand some people may find their strict policy of no alterations/substitutions (including a ban on ketchup) to be almost draconic but is it too harsh to simply suggest just ordering another option on their menu?\n\nTheir beer selection is always revolving and never disappoints because of its vast selection.\n\nMy one quibble with this restaurant is that its open seating arrangement can often leave even midsized groups (3 or more people) waiting for a while for adequate seating before being able to finally dig in to their delicious meat sandwich.",

I really liked the fries. Very thinly cut. Well known fact that the mastery of the chef is judged by knife work. We don't know whether they cut it by hand or not but the owner obviously knows that the cut and sizing are important for human palate. Beware that the place is small, looks like a regular pub. Dark lighting. Ladies can hang their fancy accessories on hooks by the bar stand. Lots of varieties of beer and ale. Enjoy the juicy burger with beer. Manly manly meal. Lol",

You'll get your fill of craft beers, fun progressions, and subtle tastes you can notice with your other beer snob friends. I should preface by saying I do not drink beer often, so this could very well be a beer drinker's paradise, as my friends have attested.\n\nNo no, I'm here for the food. Bring me the Office Burger, sweet potato fries, and an order of the chorizo croquettes, I tell the bartender (you order at the bar). It was lunchtime, so about 20 minutes later we get our food and dove right in.\n\nThe burger did live up to the hype. Thick patty, gruyere, bleu cheese, grilled onions and some spinach on top of a sandwich roll type deal. The sandwich roll is actually perfect for the burgers, since it's a bit more manageable than a regular hamburger bun. This combined with the lack of tomato not only make this a delicious burger, but one that doesn't disintegrate into a pile of mush. Stupid slippery tomato. At 14.50 with fries, it's actually a bargain.\n\nOn the other hand, the rest of the menu is meh. The chorizo croquettes that I ordered were (I think) $7 and were about the size of a large grape. With four croquettes, that's about $1.33 a croquette, plus a bit for the cilantro-y sauce served with it. They were salty, cheesy, and much greasier than I'd expected. Not worth it, but glad I tried them.\n\nThe duck confit sandwich is also worth a try, offering a nice  middle-ground for someone who wants to be a bit more adventurous than a regular burger. Salads? No, I don't eat salads at restaurants.\n\nOverall, decent place. The clientele and some of the staff are stuffy and pretentious, which is unfortunately becoming par for these establishments.",

Some sort of white cheese, caramelized onions, arugula (I think). I don't know really. Nor do I care. It's so freaking good!\n\nAll you ketchup-loving fools (like myself) out there, don't be swayed by the fact that burger's best friend is M.I.A..\n\nJust try the burger--as is.\nAnd love every juicy, mouth-gasmic minute of it.",

I also enjoyed the brussel sprouts here. My friend had a lamb dish which was also good apparently.\n\nThey have an extensive beer menu & there's probably something in there for everyone.\n\nNote that you need to be over 21 to enter (they check ID).\n\nThis Culver City location is much larger than the Santa Monica one & so better for groups.

I ordered more so I can eat it with my burger. The office burger was delicious and juicy, like really juicy. One bite and it was dripping down your wrist.

But when I tell you I have a food allergy that I did not choose to have, I had hoped you would be more understanding.

                  "review": "Well. Here it is. After coming to FO for years now, and having taken a break from this burger for a solid year, it's time to finally address this trainwreck after some inspiration tonight at the bar from the classic FO mishap.  Before I get to that, I'd like to state the fact that I still stand by the fact that this is the best burger in LA in my humble one; but after weighing the pretentious staff with this girls comments and customer experience...it shouldn't be.  It's the best burger you can get in LA so everyone keeps coming and putting up with it, but if there were other options, I'd take them.  It's not good enough to be the best burger in LA.\n\nIt's a damn good burger, don't get me wrong. The meat quality and mixture is excellent, the onion compote is a proper contrast...and the bread is usually fresh and well toasted. It's very consistent. That said, if you really weigh out each ingredient...other than the onion compote, it's under seasoned and arugula can fuck right off. Our burger nazi friend Sang Yoon is definitely an OG, and the food is ace, but someone should do it better, and give the customer a little love. I'm tired of watching people smuggle in ketchup and throw a stroke at the bar because they won't take off the bleu cheese. They're my fucking taste buds and I still say add bacon. Someone's going to make a better burger one of these days, with options...and FO will have an mutiny on their hands.  I welcome it. Bring me chaos.  \n\nI think even Sang Yoon himself knows at this point the burger could be outdone. Shit, he could outdo it himself...but who's going to fuck with a working model and experiment with another burger? I'll tell you who. Someone that's not already rich as an astronaut.  Probably someone that wanted ketchup and was told they couldn't have any and happens to cook like a champ and have a love of burgers above their own will to breathe.  Someone that wonders why  a snobby barkeep with a smelly beard is  turning his nose up at them as if you're putting him out for paying money at a restaurant he doesn't own.\n\nThe beer selection is great. They've been in kahootz with Vinny over at Russian River for years now serving up Pliny. I saw sculpin on tap tonight, which is bomb but not all that rare these days.  I wouldn't dare complain about that though. May sculpin never be difficult to find again. May it flow through the pipes of Los Angeles like toilet water. Brew on Ballast Point, in ever increasing quantities.\n\nOther delicious options on the menu are the duck confit salad, sweet potato fries (which make a better option if you like ketchup on your regular fries, fuck you if you do tough shit) and the stupid foie gras ice cream sandwich.\n\nIf you do know how to make a good burger, and you're ready to take on the best that could be better...then take the following to heart:\n\n\"I am going to be a storm, a flame. I need to fight whole armies alone.  I have ten hearts; I have a hundred arms; I feel too strong to war with mere mortals- bring me giants.\"\n\nbe",

                  "review": "My boyfriend really really really wanted to bring me here after he tried this place out with his SG. So when I came to visit- we decided to try this place out. It looked like it was a restaurant that was part of some sort of shopping mall? But I wasn't too sure because we came at night and all the stores were closed. But it was nice because all the trees had lights strapped around it- so it looked pretty at night.\n\nAlso have your ID's ready because you get carded before you can enter. It was packed on a Friday night. It's a pub- so they have alcoholic drinks with finger foods, burgers, fries, interesting appetizers. They also have outdoor seating with heaters above to keep you from freezing. The inside is really loud and super dark. Also they do not have anyone to seat you- so all tables are first come first serve. Good luck trying to find a table. We stood around and waited for a table. While we did that we looked at the menu to see what we were going to order. We had no luck finding a table until the guy who stand up front who checks your ID's tapped me to tell me there's a open table now. So thanks to him we were able to find a table. Also no one comes to you to take your order. You have to go up to the bar and place your order. Also the tables outside are super long- so if you feel like being nice and sharing by all means. We did with these funny old men.\nWe ordered the Office burger with fries and a Coke. We shared because it was huge. The fries are super thin- but just so good! The burger had Caramelized onions,gruyere, maytag blue, and arugula. The arugula actually complemented the burger and was pretty good. It also comes with some kind of sauce for the burger on the side. I don't know what that was. It's a white sauce, but that was good with the burgers. I also dipped my fries in it!",

It's $12.50 without the fries so pretty pricy... and don't let the size fool you, it is filling. And so yummy. This place also has a huge beer selection (a whole wall of handles).

Me, I went to the one in Santa Monica in the 90s, and I have to say it's been a slow change for the absolute worst.\n\nLet's get the burger out of the way: it's pretty good. But how hard can it be to slap those ingredients together? My nine year old could make the same burger, and if you asked him to leave the bleu cheese off, he'd shrug, and let you have it. Not so, with Chef Smarty-Knickers! YOU MUST HAVE BLEU CHEESE MIT DEINEN BURGER! But this is no surprise, Chef has been zero-compromise from the git-go.\n\nThe real problem with Father's Office is: it's no fun at all. \"Beer and burgers\" equals fun! So when friends and I went to F.O. (OH! Now I get it!) we brought dice to play Yahtzee - we got asked to stop. So the next time we brought Scrabble cards (they used to have Trivial Pursuit on the bar!) - we got asked to stop. We gave it one more shot with Uno on a Saturday afternoon, and guess what happened.\n\nI LOVE Pliny the Elder! Now I buy it at Beverage Warehouse on McConnell, and drink it while playing games with my friends. Sometimes I put bleu cheese on my burger, then flick it off, just to be ironic. But the attitude of NO FUN in the Office is too much fuss for very average return.",

                  "review": "I seriously don't understand how other reviewers can rate this place any lower than 4 out of 5 stars.  Father's Office is by far the best place to have a burger.  I disagree that Umami serves a better burger.  It's way way off.  I know flavor/taste is very subjective but saying Umami is better than Father's Office is ridiculous.  I've had Umami, I was underwhelmed with it's truffle burger but I will give them a chance in the future but for now, I'm reviewing father's office.\n\nIf my out of town guests wants a burger, as long as they are 21+ years old, this is THE place to bring them.  The burgers are fantastically great. Well seasoned, well built burger.  Medium rare is how you should order it.  Do not go beyond medium rare and complain why the patty is dry.  No matter how great the beef is, you go beyond medium rare, it's no good.\n\nMy gripe with the complainers.  If you notice, they complain for the sake of complaining.  First, ketchup.  I don't understand why you have to go against what the chef would suggest.  I feel that the only reason why they want ketchup is because F.O. doesn't want you to have ketchup.  Other restaurant have \"we politely decline substitutions\", so what makes F.O. different?  Nothing, so grow up and enjoy the damn burger as is.  If you don't want to, you're more than welcomed to go to another burger joint and pour all the ketchup you want on their flavorless burger.  Some of you just want to go against the grain, like putting soy sauce on a seasoned sushi already.  I don't see some of you bring soy sauce to an omakase so why ketchup to F.O?\n\nanyways, ending my rant.  The weather was perfect for us to chill at the patio, burger was wonderful, sweet potato fries were awesome, my allagash white was perfect to wash down all that wonderful food.",

You can't hold the onions which are cooked with pork. You can peel them off your hamburger after you get it, but the pork juices are already all over your beef. Also the burger in itself just isn't that great.\n\nThere is no wait staff; you order at the bar. Which would be fine.. but, unfortunately the bartenders there are jerks. If you don't want any beer you are treated like a second class citizen. Also I don't appreciate how they don't serve a true full bar - they only have Whisky pretty much. They are upper echelon elitists who won't serve Vodka and other types of liquor because it's not high brow enough for them apparently.\n\nI've tried all the other stuff on the menu, including the fish cakes, which are gross - and everything is deep friend and/or cooked with pork. Seating is hard to come by because it's super popular with the Culver City beer patrons. The nicest thing I have to say about it is the neon signage and design which tricks people into loving it.",

A pub that serves real food (I just learned this term today).\n\nMy reason for the two-star rating:\n\n1) Their specialty, a hamburger, was too sweet for me.  It had caramelized onions in it and my friend informed me beforehand that I cannot make any modifications in the burger.\n\n2)  Another reason for the two stars, was that you had to go to the bar to order the food.  No waiter service here.  That would have been fine with me except that TWICE they overlooked me and served someone else.\n\n3) When I was done with my food but still had a lot on on plate, the busboy came over and swooped up my plate.  In the same breath, he also asked me if I was done.  Shouldn't he have asked me first?  Oh well, I was done anyway and maybe he was psychic.\n\n4) The restroom sinks' lighting is practically none.  So, ladies, should you wish to freshen up and need to peer at yourself in the mirror, bring a flashlight.\n\nOther than my listed complaints above, the doorman and bartenders were pleasant.  The place was cool--minimalist with a lot of wood panelling.  Dark like a pub but not grungy.",

The bar and outside patio were okay, but it is what you would expect for a trendy Los Angeles/Hollywood gastropub. If you're a serious hipster beer snob, you'll love this place. Their service wasn't friendly, they gave off the whole hipster vibe, acting like they're too cool to be serving you. At first I was not sure where to sit and when we finally found an empty table, I wasn't sure where to order their infamous burger. After 5 minutes of just sitting there and waiting for a server, I realized I should ask the bartender, in which I did. He said I would just order the food through the bar and his attitude wasn't too friendly, acting like I should have known that.\n\nAs 98% of the reviewers on here, I ordered a beer, office burger and fries. There are about 4 things on the menu and people rave here for the burger so not too surprising. Meat in the burger was great. Bread was not bad. Was it a bad burger? No. My girlfriend and I were not that impressed. We both figured it was too far of a drive for us and it would be our last time here until they change their customer service ethics and/or when they tweak their menu. Thanks Father's Office, I finally ate at this over-hyped place and now I can check it off my list...but won't be coming back here anytime soon",

The bathrooms are super cute (Sons & Daughters, nice touch).\n\nWhen I came in it was my first time and it was kind of an off hour on a rainy Sunday evening. This was great because it wasn't busy and my friend and I got the back, corner area to ourselves. We had eaten before getting there, so we weren't hungry and didn't pay much attention to the food menu.\n\nI appreciated that there were cocktails listed along with fancy beers and a (very) small wine list. As tends to happen at such places, my wine (white zin, for anyone paying attention) is never listed. And the drinks were a bit obscure for me, but I enjoyed the Oaxacan Fizz I sipped (like a Margarita, that's missing the salted rim, and is fizzy).",

If you are into craft and tap beers this place is a heaven for you. If you are into good bar food the place can be a nightmare. Back to the blue cheese. They put it on the hamburgers and the delicious looking beet salad. When I asked if it these items can be served without blue cheese, the  answer was no. Take it or leave it. I guess this approach is OK if you are a bar and do not have a focus on your food. Seems pretty arrogant to me that you simply could not leave these items off for those that don't wish them as the food is cooked to order. Oh by the way don't ask for ketchup either as they will not accommodate that request  for your burger or their mediocre fries. The friend of mine that I was there with ordered the hamburger and fries and gave the burger a 7 out of 10. Although he commented that the hamburger bun was a 2 out of 10. The burger itself looked delicious. As for the fries they looked and tasted pretty ordinary and you might as well skip them in favor of something else on the menu.\n\nYou should go to this place for their beers , they have a wonderful selection and I did enjoy the one that I ordered. If you're out for good bar food there are many other options in close proximity that would be more satisfying.",

Most of their beers were local and could cater to the various tastes of any beer aficionado.\n\nI could definitely see any young professional coming here with friends or coworkers after a day of hard work.\n\nFor all the alcoholics out there, they do serve strong drinks that are lovingly crafted.\n\nWarnings\n- For people, who aren't fans of bleu cheese, it might be better to order a non-burger entree.\n- They serve shoestring fries instead of steak fries for any fries snobs out there.\n- This place is definitely not for people on a starving undergrad/grad budget.",

So much better than those other burger places in LA (like Umami). Their other offerings are just as unique and delicious. The menu changes pretty often, so I highly recommend trying many of the other menu items as well. I do want to note that the kitchen does not allow for any sort of changes/substitutions for the food, but you really wouldn't want to anyways!  They also don't have ketchup, so don't bother asking for it. Their fries are ADDICTING. Perfectly fried. So crispy and yummy. And the garlic sauce that they are served with....probably laced with crack. That aioli is AMAZING.\n\nThey have an awesome selection of beers on tap and in bottles. They also offer wine and old fashioned cocktails. The best beer I've had there is the Orval from Belgium. It's $12 for a bottle, but it was very good.  I tried their desserts for the first time about a month ago. AMAZING DESSERTS. I am a huge fan of their Rice Crispies Treat bon bon.\n\nIf you want to avoid the crowds, go early or go for lunch. There will be a wait if you get there after 530pm. Parking can be hard to find when they're crowded, but it's not impossible to deal with. Also, they card at the door, so DONT FORGET YOUR ID :)\nBurger+Fries\nRice Crispies Bon Bons!",

They have servers bringing you the meal, so why not have them take your order? Why do i have to get up and go to the bar if I need extra ketchup or something, when every other restaurant takes care of this by providing servers? You already have them serving the meals, why not have them take the order too?!\n\nAnyway, aside from that gripe, the food was alright. I kept hearing about this burger but it wasn't anything above and beyond the other contenders in the city. The beer selection was good too, but again, pretty average for a \"gastropub,\" if you can call Father's Office that.",

                  "review": "F.O... has been crowned by many to be the best burger joint in Los Angeles. Albeit tasty, their burger sandwich left a little to be desired. I was looking for more texture, to be completely honest. It seems they used a toasted Mexican roll as their choice of bread, which I didn't really think had enough of a bite. In my opinion, the bread itself wasn't bold enough for the large patty and utlra-caramelized onions. Even if the burger was probably the juiciest I've ever had, I simply could not get past the bread being so weak. Don't get me wrong... it was a good sandwich, just not exactly perfect. If anything, it was slightly on the sweeter side, which I wasn't totally a fan of.\n\nThe one thing I did find very impressive was their beer selection. I imagine Homer Simpson coming here and sampling everything directly from the tap (no glass pouring necessary as it wastes drinking time). I had the Red Ale, and it was delicious.\n\nThey card people, and I think that is just silly. I mean... they just managed to alienate all the possible customers under 21. It doesn't affect me, of course, but I am all about equal rights you know. Another annoyance is that they are super strict with their no food from outside policy. I get that restaurants should not allow food from outside in, but our group chose Father's Office specifically for a birthday celebration, and they would not allow a tiny little individual birthday cake in (even after we offered to purchase a dessert as well). That's a new one... I've never seen a restaurant do that. They weren't jerks about it, but it was still very disappointing.\n\nI cannot recommend F.O. for the burger itself, but for everything else by all means. I am not quite a fan, so I cannot give this place 4 stars. 3.5 stars it is.",

It might be because we got bomb parking right outside, and for free too (rare thing in LA these days). It also might be because we managed to find a seat in less than 10 minutes.  \n\nEverything about the burger just meshed so well together.  The meat was so juicy, the 2 different types of cheeses weren't too overwhelming to take over the burger but still added that kick, the arugula added the perfect crisp to the whole thing, and don't even get me started on that caramelized onion concoction whatever it is... it all melded together with the hoagie bread.  Wow, I feel like I am professing my undying love for this burger and it still doesn't do it justice.  The sweet potato fries were amazing as well!  When our food came, me and the boyfriend stopped talking entirely for a good 7 minutes (that was all the time it took for us to devour our meal).  \n\nTheir beer selection is astonishing.  Settled on the Allagash White.  It was very good, and I recommend it!\n\nThe only slight, minuscule set back I have with FO is the way they do their seating.  Yes, I understand it is a bar so it's open seating, but it is just plain awkward when you have to shuffle back and forth between the bar, the outside patio, and the inner room and then stalk people down as you impatiently wait (and subconsciously pressure them)  to finish their food.  I think it would be more logical and organized for them to implement a sign up seat system like every regular restaurant has because, cmon, as many beers as they have, I'm really there for the burger.  Overall, the seating problem is not enough to deter me from coming back again.  Fighting for a seat is a small price to pay for the BEST BURGER OF MY LIFE!",

Yes, it's easily one of the best burgers in Los Angeles, and no, you can't ask for ketchup with it. Whether you order it with regular fries (very thinly sliced with an amazing aioli) or sweet potato fries, you'll be smiling. I've probably had their burger over a dozen times, and it's consistently excellent. Their other meal options are always good to great, but aren't the reason to come here. The beer list is strong, though with so many gastropubs popping up both in Culver and everywhere else, there are other options with equally good choices. I also find that even on a busy night, getting your order at the bar doesn't take too long. My only complaint would be, that there needs to be more indoor seating, but that's mainly because I am a thin skinned sissy.",

                  "review": "I think Father's Office is good. Too me, it was never hyped up like crazy so it's not like I had these huge expecations.\n\nI think there are a few reasons why I had a pleasant-ish experience:\n1. K and I were able to find a seat pretty quickly. First by the bar, then two people left a 4person table so we took those two seats and sat next to 2 funny women.\n2. Actual burger is good, pretty flavorful. I mean I LOVE arugula and sweet & savory stuff so I guess if you don't like either of that then...don't come here. Also I love thin crispy fries. These were thin, crispy, and well seasoned.\n3. Price point is okay! For a trendy burger place, it was more than acceptable. To me, the burger + fries were MORE than filling.\n\nWeird tiff:\nK's beer seemed flat. Like, pretttty flat. I wanted to inquire to the bartender but K said it was okay so I didn't.\nAlso, I woudn't NOT wait more than 30min for this place. Otherwise yes, go here.\n\nOR....just go to Cheesecake Factory and get the Macaroni Cheese Burger, it will blow your mind. I swear, I haven't found a burger that tops it. Not even here :P",
