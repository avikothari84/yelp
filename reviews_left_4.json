The tacos themselves weren't very flavorful and the shells were soggy as if they filled with meat beforehand and waited to be served. My friend and I both ordered enchiladas and after one bite, pushed it to the side. They sauce is more of Mole than an enchilada sauce. I tasted nutmeg or cinnamon and my friend said he got more of clove taste. Regardless, we didn't like them. Maybe we came on a bad day but either way, we won't come back.",

I arrived at 9:45pm on a Saturday... The line was out the door! To make a long story short we ended up waiting over 1.5 hours! I was thinking to myself this wait better be worth it... Unfortunately, it was just \"meh\". Don't get me wrong the food was good... It just didn't live to the hype.\n\nI ordered tacos w/cheese, meat burrito, beef tamale, rice and beans. I wanted to try a little of everything. The tacos were alright, the ground beef actually resembles real quality meat, the cheese on the other hand was very iffy... Seemed like low quality greasy government cheese. The tamales were great! The burrito was also great. Tacos were just overrated.\n\nWill I ever wait in a 1.5 hour long line just for tacos? I don't think so. I'll probably go back during the day when its not too busy.\nThis line is worse than the 1973 oil crisis gas station lines!!!",

There's also limited street parking around the area, so if you see a spot relatively close by, you might just want to take it and consider yourself lucky.\n\nYou'll notice the place when you drive by, as it usually has a long line of people standing out front. I actually can't recall a time I've driven by it and haven't seem some kind of line waiting. You can order from the windows on the inside our outside. I don't think it really matters which one you take (inside or outside). The lines are a little on the slow side, although this can be totally a hit or miss. After you get to the front and are finished ordering, just remember who took your order and wait around for a minute. They don't really take the next order until they're done with yours, which is why the lines tend to be slow. It's also cash only, so make sure you have some.\n\nInside there is a few tables for seating. They always seem to be occupied, so this place tends to be better for take out.\n\nAs for the food, it's nothing fancy, but it's solid in my opinion. The taco's and salsa are my favorite. I usually put some of the salsa inside my taco, making it perfect for me so that the taco isn't too dry and has a little extra flavor. I often find myself getting stuffed on the chips and salsa because of how good it is (the salsa I mean). The burrito's are ok. The meat burrito is literally just meat inside a burrito, so don't expect lettuce, tomato, etc inside.\n\nOverall, solid and affordable food. It's an experience coming here. Knowing what to expect will definitely help to make your order easier and more efficient.\nThere is 6 taco's in there, plus 2 burrito's buried under the chips.",

This is a place you could go everyday for a year and they wouldn't even notice.

Over $4.50 with cheese?\n\nOkay then, maybe I shouldn't get a burrito there. What about the tacos? Almost three dollars a piece? If I wanted to I could get tacos at a late night happy hour for better quality.\n\nSo why go? Because you get those chips which makes you get that guacamole which gives you those memories.\n\nIt's just that getting those memories is starting to hurt, especially when you always need cash to trade for tacos.\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool\n2/13/2008Previous review\nSo basically, from the gist of the poor reviews I've read here, people thought that the food was disgusting and/or its not authentic Mexican.\n\nNo offense to those who gave poor reviews, but the massive lines pretty much speak for themselves. You are in the minority.\n\nIf you have a refined palette, then why the hell are you expecting 4-star quality dining at a cash-only fast-food taco stand?!\n\nOf course its not authentic Mexican. It never claims to be!\n\nI simply recommend that everyone try a taco of theirs at least once, without expecting the sun to explode and Jesus to arrive once you bite into it (as apparently some Yelpers have done).\n\nIn conclusion: long lines speak volumes more about a restaurant than the whole Yelp community put together.",

There were no long lines and it was all family ran. My dad shook hands with the owner who told my dad he wanted to make good food at fair prices. Well that was almost 50 years ago, and now it's just a money machine. You buy a taco, put salsa on it, and you have to drain the water from either the salsa and or lettuce. The specials that were around those first few years are gone. This \"icon\" status is just over hype. If you want REAL Mexican food, drive 2 1/2 miles south west to Culver & Inglewood Blvd, to El Abajeno\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n2/6/2010Previous review\nTitos USED to be a fair priced place for basic Mexican food. I was a patron from 1960 ( when they were on Sepulveda) and no longer go there. For the amount of business they have, their prices are more than El Abajeno a few miles away. The burritos are smaller than before, and they could expanded their menu to include things like Nachos, and quesdillas.  Sadly, they got so bigheaded they forgot about who made them who they are: There customers. Titos is overhyped\nRead more\n7/4/2009Previous review",

I am growing older but you are the same vibrant bloom...  you are a magical creation, please don't change, please outlive me!!!\n\nLong after waving the LA area goodbye as home, I cannot stay away from Titos for long.  Titos has caused trips to LA.  Titos has taken me out of my way.  And it's always worth it.  \n\nI guess this is a YMMV place.  Some people want modern fusions and the more exotic central and south american takes on la cocina.  I must have a lot of peasant karma in me, because the essential nature of Titos is IT.  The meat and sauce - that hint of cloves that took me 30+ years to figure out - is singular and intoxicating.  Blended with the sinful frijoles refritos and a basic cheddary indulgnence, wrapped in a perfectly textured, steamy, chewy tortilla, the Titos burrito is something manifested from Heaven to the mortal world, just to prove that Heaven does indeed exist.\n\nThe shredded beef tacos are so simple, and so delicious.  The chips are real, hot, fresh.  Their salsa is a bit watery, but somehow, strangely, it is the perfect complement to the main fare.  \n\nDon't let me forget the entertainment value... we always meet friendly people at the communal tables outside... and enjoy the perennial flock of 'taco birds' all around.\n\nWriting this has got me thinking of reasons to go through the west LA in the near future...  Titos! Yo te amo!  Ole!",

I can't really pinpoint anything specific that makes the taco delicious--perhaps it's the combined whole of all the ingredients--shredded beef in a thick, crunchy tortilla shell with a bit of lettuce and loads of shredded cheese.  Top that with their salsa and you have a mouthful of crunchy, beefy, cheesy goodness.  Love that they include free chips and salsa with your order.  The consistency of the salsa is a bit too watery for me, but the flavor is pretty good.\nLuckily I'm often in the neighborhood, so I'm always scoping out the lines and dropping by only when the lines are shorter.",

I hate being wrong.\n\nSince I live about 5 minutes away from this place, I've always been curious about eating here. After 2 years of living 5 minutes away, and always judging pictures on yelp of the oddly taco-bell looking tacos with horrible looking salsa but hearing rave reviews from friends and other yelpers, my husband and I finally took a shot and gave them a visit.\n\nSo very wrong. The tacos, although looking very lame and nothing special, are amazingly flavored, not too greasy (this IS mexican food after all), and crispy not stale. The salsa, although also appearing nothing special, is fresh tasting and pairs extremely well with the taco. The beef burrito is a bit much, although with good flavor and tender beef, is very heavy (would definitely recommend sharing). Their chips are a welcome side.\n\nThis is no traditional mexican food, and of course there are way better joints out east. But for West LA, and for a fast food joint, this place is definitely worth returning to!\n\nMinus half a star though for the long long long long long lines. But I understand the lines now at least lol.",

I was definitely surprised to find a hard taco, as I've come to expect soft tacos from just about every taco stand in Los Angeles.  It ended up being pretty bland and just okay.  They also throw in tortilla chips into your box which is rather redundant, because you're just eating more of what is their flavorless taco shells.\n\nThey do have a parking lot and lines weren't very bad during a weekday afternoon.  Although, judging by their speed, I can see the waits being pretty bad during busy times.  I expected faster with their production line style cooking.  I may come back if I'm in the area, but it's definitely not a destination taco.",

So I find that we circle around or just sit and wait for a spot to open up.  But after looking at that line and hearing the tummy sing, we resort to finding parking elsewhere\n\n:Lines:\nPeople from all over, mostly locals like to stand in the long line for a TACO! (I did it), why not? Pretend you are in line waiting for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride!\n\n:Payment:\nCASH ONLY!  (best form of payment)\nHowever, there is an ATM literally next to the front counter.  Why not? There's no excuse for not buying a taco.\n\n:Taste:\nFor me, this is where I'm stuck in between, \"it is good? do I like it? was it worth it? would I go back?\" Those questions pop up in my head as I'm biting, chewing and eventually swallowing the taco.\n\nOkay, here goes....yes, they are greasy, but hey its a frigging TACO, right?? What do you expect? I don't get why people complain about that. Ohhh...I forgot we live in LA! The meat is eh, not too bad but I think it could use a tad bit more flavor.  It's basic with the shredded lettuce and cheddar cheese.  I do love cheese.  That's a plus for me =).  The salsa is alright. It's pureed and I did like spooning the salsa onto the taco so every bite was more flavorful.  AND it didn't have cilantro lol. One thing that bugged me is the darn guacamole.  I was like wth is this green goop stuff? It was really runny.  It was the first time I've ever added guacamole with my order. It didn't have much flavor, and wished it had some kick.  It looked like pea soup...eww!\n\nI will probably go back when I'm in the neighborhood again and feeling like a taco. And yes, I'll probably go back and wait in that line too. Perhaps when I go back a few more times, my rating will change but for now, i'll just keep it in the middle.  It's useful for late night drunken munchies or whatever.",

I waited in the long line and got my food. I wasn't impressed.  Maybe it was all the authentic food I was raised on, or maybe it was because it had no taste.  I tried a few more times and ended up getting sick a lot and haven't been back since.\n\nIt seems to be very popular with the out of towners, tourists and film crews.  The film people are the worst because they think they own the place, are jerks and think Tito's is the bomb.  I guess if you have no taste in Hispanic food Tito's is the place for your sorry soul. Disgusting!\n\nThere always seems to be a traffic jam around this place with people in their big stupid cars buying crates of this crap. Its really ghetto with the tinted windows and sound systems... i guess they have to have somewhere to show off.... what better place than a crappy taco stand under the freeway?",

                  "review": "This was one of the worst burrito experiences I ever had.  \n\nFirst, they only serve beef, so don't be fooled by \"meat\" on the menu. They mean they only have one \"meat\". Supposedly, it's beef, or \"beef\" as in the weird brown-saucy mess that places like Taco Bell try to pass off as meat.\n\nSecond, they put your to-go order in a flimsy brown box so when you go out to the parking lot, the box bends and collapses, making you drop all your chips and fork.  And the fork turns out to be the most important part of the whole ordeal, because when you try to pick up your unwrapped burrito, it falls apart in your hands, making it completely un-eatable, oh if only you had a fork, right?  Well, that's on the ground of the dirty parking lot.\n\nSo, you throw your baby-poo-looking mess of a burrito away and drive down to Yak-in-the-box, where at the very least, they know how to make food that you can hold in your hand.\n\nLA staple? Pulease.",

There is nothing on the menu that is less than terrific. I love the burrito ( just meat) or the chili con carne and always a meat taco. There is always several lines at the ordering windows - a testament to its greatness. But, ordering and getting your food is quicker than most restaurants with table service. I think this says it best- I was on a Greek Island and told a European couple that I was from LA, and their first question was: have you been to Titos Tacos?",

                  "review": "I'm still on what is turning into a never-ending quest to find a good Mexican place in LA near me.  My latest attempt landed me at Tito's Tacos.  Some people, including LA natives, swear Tito's is the place to go.  And they have this wonderful commercial with a catchy song.\n\nWhen I got there, the building looked sufficiently \"hole-in-the-wall\"-ish and there was a line.  The set up was like a large taco stand.  You went up to a window, placed your order and sat at one of the few picnic style tables outside.  Promising...  I looked around for the menu which turned out to be a large board behind the counter with only a few listings.  Hrm...  I see \"burrito\" and the only options were beans, meat w/ beans and...that's it?  What sort of meat?  Shredded beef?  No carne asada?!?!?!  Well, damn...there goes my hopes and dreams.\n\nI ordered a meat burrito but without the beans; I'm a believer in the carne asada + guacamole + cheese + pico de gallo burrito.  None of that rice n' beans filler stuff.  I want MEAT!   I also ordered 2 tacos for my husband, plain with just meat n' cheese.  Since they only accept cash at Tito's Tacos, I had to make use of the atm machine on the side of the building.   I waited for about 5 minutes before my order was called.  I paid ($9 + change) and got my food which was packaged in a box (think In-n-Out) with a cover.\n\nWhen I got home and opened up the box, I saw a fairly plump burrito, two very sad looking tacos, chips and a cup of salsa.\n\nI didn't try the tacos but the husband said they weren't very good and that he would be fine if he never ate them again.  Taco Bell has better.\n\nAs for the burrito, it was stuffed full of shredded beef and some cheese but it was bland.  I kept throwing more and more Tapatio just to get some flavor.  It really was unappetizing and I had to force myself to finish it (\"Thou shalt not waste food...\").  The amount of meat in it was...heavy, almost bordering on too much.  It is a filling burrito and if there was something for my taste buds to latch on to, it would have been okay.\n\nI guess the best part of the meal were the chips which were a little stale and the very mild salsa.  I should have dumped the salsa into the burrito...\n\nI don't understand how people think Tito's Tacos is great.  What am I missing?  This was probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had and I doubt I will return. The fact that I dished out almost $10 for it just adds salt to the wound.\n\nFor the first time ever, the Catty Critic gives out a hairball rating.  I wish Yelp allowed 0 stars cuz that's what I really want to give Tito's Tacos.\n\nNow to convince the husband that, no, we really should move back to San Diego, if only so I can get GOOD Mexican food again...",

People would ask me if I'd been there, did I love it, etc. So I finally ambled down to Culver City, and... eh.\n\nThe tacos are good, but they're nothing to write home about. In fact, until now, I've never felt the need to write about Tito's Tacos before.\n\nI'm most surprised that so many people share my point of view. I thought I was the only one unmoved. So why is there always a long line?",

No consistency at all! Good luck trying to pick it up and eat it with your hands. It'll without a doubt fall apart by the time you take one bite. Also, re-fried beans? Zero flavor whatsoever.\n\nLastly, the service was terrible. Lines everywhere, the counter women are all rude and there's little to no organization with the lines nor the way food comes out. People just crowd the windows as if it were a soup kitchen, which it might as well be...",

When I went to order the tacos they told me they were hard-shell tacos, I was not pleased with this so I order a burrito that was too salty. That was about the only flavor I tasted! I also ordered salsa and they gave me pickled jalape\u00f1os smashed up trying to resemble a salsa. It was gross.\n\nTime went by and we told some friends how salty and tasteless the burrito was but  one guy said to try that hard-shell tacos that he really liked. Today we were around Tito's Tacos and decided to stop and get some tacos.\n\nPeople DON'T BE DECEIVED although there are big lines the tacos are tasteless. I have had tacos all my life and by far these have been the WORST EVER. They are simply a fried tortilla with meat and they add lettuce and a lot of yellow cheese. The red salsa is also tasteless and the guacamole is also bad. It is really hard to make a bad guacamole but here at Tito's they screwed up pretty bad.\n\nIf you want and like hard-shell tacos simply go to Taco Bell, they are much cheaper and a lot tastier.",

The burritos are delicious, and the guacamole is always fresh.

They make burritos, tacos, and tamales. They hit the spot.\n\nIf you want an expensive highend Mexican meal, get back on the 405 and head to El Cholo in Santa Monica.\n\nYummy!",

I love their all meat burritos with the red sauce oozing out of it. Can someone email me of a similar all meat burrito with sauce like this in the Long Beach or Orange County areas? I've been looking but the only burritos I come across are mainly dry. I don't eat Mexican much because of the fat and etc. but the food here always brings me back. Mexicatessen on Atlantic in Monterey Park about 30-40 years ago had the same food to a \"Tee\"...childhood memories and the extra salt on the hard shell tacos, yum!  PS. I grew up near East LA so I know authentic Mexican food. But this place still gets my vote.",

One person is taking care of you at the window, he/she will get your drinks (in the mean time walking all around the kitchen to get you tacos/burritos/chips and dodging 20 other co-workers  in between...so every little thing they're getting you takes about 20 times longer...I mean...really??!! REALLY???!!!  Ever heard of an \"assembly line\"? So things get done faster and more efficient? Don't get me wrong, people were nice and I felt taken care of ...once I got to the window :(  ...however, with that much hassles...I was expecting a completely flavorful, robust meal with true Mexican flavors...but it was just \"OK\"! .....so I never really went back. Sorry for all the Tito's fans, we may not agree on this.... I \"L-O-V-E\" Mexican food, but I've had much better Mexican food elsewhere...like taco truck on Venice/La Brae, on Wester/Fountain, or at the famous \"El Taurino\" on Hoover ...I mean C'mon!!   : |",

Lines are long, parking can be difficult, but there are spots on Washington Place, under the overpass.  Get tacos with cheese, they are about $2 per taco and the salsa IS homemade and fresh....best salsa I've had, even better than my own!!!   I'm not a fan of the burritos, but that's just personal preference.  It's good to know that it's cash only, and if you go regularly, tip them out well, they will remember you and hook you up with extras when you return.  The only thing better than a Tito's taco....is 2.",

The salsa is so good I order the largest extra they will give me every time. It's fresh and mild and tasty, I almost want to drink it. I am a mild salsa fan. The tacos are good, love the generous amount of cheese on everything, as long as you order the food with cheese and pay extra. But the meat and bean and burrito is so unbelievably good! I love that rich red sauce the meat is in, and the beans are fantastic. I am native to Los Angeles and have eaten my share of authentic Mexican food which I love also...but I still get in my car and drive from Long Beach to Tito's when the craving strikes. It's that good! Give me this Gringo food anytime! I prefer to go food from Tito's. I do not recommend eating on site. It's just not comfortable at all. Bring cash, like every other review reminds you to do.",

It's basic, no frills, cheap ($2-3) and delicious Mexican fast food with only about a dozen items on the menu.  I've been going there since I was in elementary school and now that I no longer live in the area I try to go every time I come to LA.  While prices have increased a little, and there are a couple of new menu items that add chicken, not much has changed over the last 20 or so years.  The tacos are deep fried with the shredded beef and lettuce with or without cheese inside; Tito's does not serve soft tacos.  My preference though is their burrito, which you can get either all beef or beef with refried beans.   The beef is stewed to perfection and is super tender, though one must be delicate in handling the burrito or else it'll spill on you.  You'll also get a little cup of tomato salsa (their very finely grated version of pico de gallo) and a jalapenyo salsa (upon request), as well as a side of tortilla chips.  I also like getting their tasty guacamole.  Don't expect the chunky kind, it's kind of a puree.  Other menu items include tostada, enchilada, and tamale.  The diverse clientele lines up particularly during lunch hour.",

The Russian people, at that time, had to wait in long lines to buy everything, often not knowing what they were waiting for, just hoping it was something they could use or eat.  Soon, a huge long line formed around the block because the people at the front of the line (soccer players) started passing back false information down the line as to what it was they were waiting for.  The players slowly started to get out of line so that it would move, and soon the huge crowd grew restless.  Finally the soccer players left, so they wouldn't get attacked.  In the end, the people slowly made it to the locked door, only to find there was nothing there, and that they had been fooled, and had wasted the better part of their day.  I felt the same way after eating at Titos.",

I have to say this was a habitual place to go and get great beef  tacos, but in the last few years the food  quality has gone down.  First thing I noticed was that the tortillas they use for the tacos had been changed, they never used to be tough and chewy.  Now, recently  the flavor of the beef is not the same or better yet, there is no flavor.  The cheese on the tacos (which is now 55 cents more per taco) just doesn't have the sharp cheddar taste like it used to.  As a kid I remember standing in line to get some of the best tacos you could get and the best salsa.  The salsa is still good, but I just cant see waiting in line for 30 minutes or more for just the salsa.  Next time I role into town I will just head to Lucy's for the best chicken tacos which have not changed since I was a kid.  Looks like Tito's Tacos infamous commercial at  4:00 a.m. which says  \"Whats better than a Tito's taco? TWO\"   Should say a Lucy's chicken taco is better than a Tito's taco.   Too Bad.",

                  "review": "is it really worth 5 stars? no, not really. the lines are long, the menu is limited, the parking lot cramped and they only take cash. HOWEVER i had to give them a 5 to conteract all of the elitist foodies who give the place 1 star. Personally, I only get the tacos, because when \"taco\" is in the name, it seems only fitting that you order tacos. the tacos are greasy and good, but the best part is the salsa that comes with. together they create a symphony of greasy, savory flavor that only the culinary masters at Tito's can pull off (also, I have found that ordering in Spanish makes them like you more). obviously, this place is not authentic mexican, but that doesnt mean it isnt good. anyone who gives this place 1 star is just being an elitist jerk who is trying to poo-poo the tastes of the hoards of people who obviously love this place. Think about it, would Tito's consistently have a line out to the street if this place was really only 1 or 2 stars? get over yourselves, foodies. Tito's is an LA establishment and isn't going away because a few douches give it low ratings",

Skipped adding the rice and beans since I preferred to fill up on the tacos after reading the reviews. Favored the fish taco more, so I ordered an extra one. Although the taco size was on the smaller side, the filling was generous and satisfying after having 3 tacos.\n\nDefinitely would come back to eat here, especially during their Wednesday specials! :)",

Ceviche was nothing special, although it did hit the spot, and the fish tacos are solid.\n\nHowever, and while this is good for them-- they got in a pair of big orders. Then. Well. They filled our little individual orders before doing the backlog. Which was fine. Except they missed one of our group. He went up to the counter at least three times as they handed the rest of us our food, then it felt like he still had to wait an eternity.\n\nAgain, good for them that they're getting so much business, but in the end the food didn't seem worth the wait.",

Online orders were ready as soon as I arrived.\n\nSince then, dozens of visits later, each experience has been worse than the last. What started out as just ok service has deteriorated into 1 hour waits and botched orders: every one of they last half dozen or so has had something wrong, whether missing or incorrect items. Doing a thorough count of bagged items catches the missing burrito before you're on your way, but it doesn't catch issues like tacos that are bare (literally just a piece of fish and a tortilla - where's the rest of it???) or the wrong kind of cheese on the nachos until you get home and actually open the container.\n\nEven worse is when I arrive 15-30 minutes after placing an online order to see they hadn't even seen it and then watch them place it in the queue... at the end. They are never nice about it either. No apologies and the same dismissive \"10 or 15 minutes longer\" that drags on to the aforementioned hour.\n\nAll the while, the food's been getting more inconsistent. So why bother anymore?\n\nI think this all started once they started expanding to other locations and the pandemic made their problems handling online orders that much more of an issue.",

I went down to the establishment in 30 minutes and the lady stated they didn't receive my order. I showed her my order on the phone. She wrote down the order and said it would be ready quick. I didn't mind the wait thinking it would take 10-15 minutes.\n\n30 minutes pass by and no food. During this time they received and provided food for 10 different orders. I decide to walk up to the same lady and ask her for my food. She looks at me and says, yes what would you like to order? I'm like are you kidding me? I ordered 30 minutes ago and you said you would call out my name when it was ready.\n\nObviously, she didn't remember my order or my name. I gave her my name again and in a rack just behind her was my order. Not only did this establishment mess up my online order, they even forgot the order they took in-person. Seems like the lady was too busy telling me that I need to pick a soda can from the fridge to complete my order. She made sure to remind me every time we spoke even though she didn't remember to call out my name when was order was ready.\n\nThe shrimp and fish tacos were cold and were ladened with mayonnaise (pictures attached). The other tacos that I ordered were packaged all wrong and all I got was a hot mess. Take your money elsewhere.  Needless to say, I will not be returning to this establishment.",

Cook made these big tacos stuffed with goodness!\n\nCons: everything else... The cashier was on the patio eating and came in wiping his hands on his pants to ring up our order.  Not knowing if he was going to prepare or handle our food, we asked him to wash up, which he begrudgingly did.  There were handwritten signs everywhere and the syrup boxes for the drink dispenser are on a silver cart out in the open area where customers are.  The patio table tops were not clean, so if they did not clean/sanitize before us, we were not confident they would after us.  The smoke detector low battery alarm was chirping every 30 seconds, and when I brought to their attention, he said 'yeah, we know when need to put new batteries in.\"   Um, ok.\n\nFood/cook: 5 stars.  Facility/cashier: 1 star.\nSo, 3 stars overall.  \n\nI will be back because the food is so good and to upgrade my review if they get some of the things fixed/addressed.",

Of course it's all about their fish tacos which is tasty but their shrimp tacos are even better.  I keep talking about shrimp bit this is just a coincidence...I have my favorite places for other types of meats. This place is my go-to place in the area for fish and shrimp tacos.\n\nThere is a parking lot and street parking is generally easy.",

The fish tacos were close to half the size they used to be. The styrofoam containers were worth more than the tacos. (tons of styrofoam). I paid for both types of salsa and only got one. If you gotta have salsa like me it's a pisser. I used to like this place a lot but no mas. It looks like a dirty operation in the back I'm sorry to say also. I will give them credit for having no cilantro on the food like I ordered, that was a nice change.",

We had fish and shrimp tacos-amazing, fried fish and shrimp tacos are also good. Their cevice is fresh and juicy.\nThe place itself it good too. Small cafe along the street. There is seating inside but outside are much better spots. Nothing fancy jUst some really good tacos. There are no servers there, you order, they call your number, you eat and clean after yourself.\nI would definitely be stopping by more especially after a beach day on Venice. Perfect treat after sun and ocean. Highly recommend too try this place.\nGrilled fish and shrimp taco\nFried fish taco",

I've been to Mariscos restaurants before and the smell in these restaurants would be so over whelming my head would hurt but this place was great though.. no over powering seafood smell at all. I had pollo and asada sopes and my friend had ceviche (my first time trying it) and we both enjoyed the food. The only reason why I gave 4 stars is because the location is not ideal. It seems to be a popular restaurant but there is not enough indoor seating and the parking lot does not allow for as many customers as they could have if they were located elsewhere and had a bigger lot. Just my personal opinion but it would make the difference in me coming here again if it looks too packed and I definitely want to come back!",

We finally managed to stop in and see what this place was all about.\n\nWe ordered the fish tacos and shrimp tacos....both were amazing! The breaded shrimp tacos were crispy yet soft and practically melted in your mouth. I fell in love after the first bite. My wife tried the grilled fish taco and for someone who loves fish tacos to say that this was by far the best she's had...that says something.\n\nThe only negative thing about this place is that the parking lot is always full so some waiting can happen, but the food comes out quickly so that makes up for it.",

It was cheap and REALLY GOOD. I got 2 fish tacos and 1 shrimp taco and a drink for less than $10 which I think is such a deal.\n\nThe tacos were fried til golden brown and had a lot of cabbage, pico and sauce on it, both of them were dressed the same. They didn't cheap out on the fish and the shrimps and they had extras on the side like limes, chilies and pepper. I'm not much of a spicy eater but I tried the green chilli and ended up drowning my tacos in it because it was good.\n\nIf you're looking for cheap eats and good tacos, check out Baja Tacos",

I ordered two fish tacos, a shrimp taco, a carne asada burrito, and a plate of nachos to share with my friend.\n\nThe fish tacos were out of this world good. The fish was battered just right and cooked fresh. I know a lot of places will have the fish sitting for a while and wrap it into the tortilla as it's being served. Everything including the veggies and tortillas were cooked and warmed on the spot.\n\nThe shrimp was just as delicious and the shrimp were all clean as well, a big no-no in my book if the shrimp isn't cleaned proper.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was different than most I've had. It was soft warm and chewy and the meat was very tender and juicy. This was a great burrito that can easily fill you up if you're just looking to eat one item.\n\nThe nachos were well layered with cheese guacamole and sour cream and each bite or nacho had all the flavor from top to bottom.  \n\nCondiments and salsas were fresh as well.\n\nOutside seating is heated so my friend and I enjoyed our food while not worrying about eating in the cold. I know I know great taco shops in LA are a dime a dozen but this seriously should be on everyone's radar. Definitely check it out.",

I SAID WHAT!!!!! How do u run out of asada by noon at a taco spot!!!!!!!!!!!! so i got one chicken plain to go, it took 20 min to give me the one taco w an order of chips, my lunch is 30 min so i was upset i had 10 min only to eat and the worse part is when i sat to eat my taco had onions and cilantro on it, i said PLAIN!!!!! ive been here before and its always good so im gonna say today they were having a bad day",

There is easy parking and it's located on the corner of Westwood and Venice with a parking entrances on both streets.  \n\nI've been twice, coincidentally both on Wednesday's when they have $1 fish tacos. The first time I went and I was really happy with the quality of fish tacos as well as the fish ceviche. You get the banana peppers for free, as many as you'd like.\n\nEach taco is adorned with cabbage, Pico de Gallo, a red salsa, and crema on top of fried fish and two corn tortillas. Pretty good for the area and I will definitely be back. They take every form of payment including Apple Pay.\n\nWhat I didn't like is that I went around 11 and asked for only one tortilla each taco, I received tacos without customization. They don't take phone orders well. I also asked for extra crema and received no such crema.  They take custom orders but don't customize your order. The fish was also a little small compared to prior weeks.\n\nOverall, I'd eat here again but these tacos aren't the stuff of dreams. They're acceptable for the west side. Bonus is that they have $1 fish tacos on Wednesday's.",

The, mostly, outdoor seating makes the joint feel super laid back and everything is heavily shaded so it never gets too bad. Just walk inside the little shack and get your order started.\n\nRight when you walk in you're greeted by a glass case displaying mounds of ceviches ready to get scooped on a tostada, which also happens to sit next to the assembly line for their shrimp cocktails. Every time I come to this place a couple of ceviches or a shrimp cocktail are NECESSARY. Is it the best ceviche I've ever had? No, but it doesn't have to be when I can get two tostadas and a soda for 6 bucks. The shrimp cocktail is awesome just because of how much shrimp they put in it. Incredible when it's hot out with all the cucumber they use.\n\nHowever, the thing you HAVE TO GET? Hard Shell Shrimp Tacos. This ain't a fried shrimp in some Taco Bell shell. They straight up just deep fry one of their shrimp tacos until the tortilla gets brown like some extra fried tortilla chips. The crunch sound they make is ungodly, like those sounds you hear on food shows that make you jealous you aren't eating what they're eating. It's legitimately become one of my favorite things to eat. Just make sure you eat it there right as it comes out!!",

After I ordered my burrito which rice is optional, weird but okay. My other half order fish tacos. The burrito was kinda average in size. The meat isn't that great. No salsa bar when you pick up your food your asked which salsa you want hot or mild. The fish tacos were not crispy. It was really Ho hum. To be a Mexican joint with Mexican food they really need to step it up. I guess the clients they have don't know the difference they dont know any better. Too much of variety and was bland. Good try tho. For what I spent it will be worth the trek back to king taco back to the east side!",

The server was cold and transactional. And pastrami was thin, brittle and dry and the top half of the bread was broken when served which made it hard to pick up the sandwich to eat. How they expected me to pick up a sandwich with broken bread is beyond me! The pastrami was so dry and lacked flavor. I had to douse it with more mustard than I normally do just to make the meat a bit more moist! After tax and tip the sandwich was $20!!!  It takes a lot for me to feel taken advantage of but this time I felt ripped off!  Seriously, Johnny Pastrami, get your act together! There are plenty of other places around town that offer a better product, loaded high with tasty robust pastrami for the same price and better service!",

From their sign to the outdoor seating to the old appearance of the building it really looks like an amazing dive. So I pulled over.\n\nOrdered a half pastrami because I was not that hungry. However I really wanted to try their signature dish. Ordered to go and it was cool how the kitchen was in the middle of the room, and the old style appeal of the joint.\n\nRight away my order was made in front of me just how I wanted it.\n\nWhen I got the sandwich I felt as if it was kinda lackluster tho. The problem is that the bread was just too dry. It was soft, but dry. Maybe this is a result of me not enjoying mustard, but I feel like that would not have helped too much.\n\nOn top of that it was $10 for not the largest sandwich in the world. While I loved the place and the staff (who presumable have been working there a long time) I just with that the sandwich itself as a little better.",

I have driven past this place so many times....yet, I never tried it. Today, I had the absolute pleasure to eat one of the best pastrami sandwiches I have ever had in my life!!!! W.O.W.!!!!!! OK, so luckily I had someone with me who suggested I get the hot pastrami on a french roll \"double dipped\" with raw onion and swiss cheese. OMG! The roll was spectacular! The meat was melt in your mouth good and sooooooo tasty! As I always do when I eat pastrami, I asked for a side of russian dressing (thousand island) and it was totally NOT needed! They have mustards on the table, and they also brought a hot mustard which the server warned...\"a little goes a long way!!\" - I love hot mustard and tasted it on the sandwich, but again, the pastrami was SO GOOD it was totally not needed! I also had to try the potato salad and cole slaw - both excellent and super tasty!!! I notice on the menu \"straight chili\", and was curious. I asked about it - it's chili with no beans. OK, go ahead and bring me a chili cheese onion fries! Epic. So damn delicious! This place is a keeper! And to my extreme pleasure, the menu says they are open til 3:30 am on the weekends!!! I love this place! The servers are so nice, the place is quaint and has such character... I can't wait to go back! Love this place!! Oh, and before I forget... the pickles!!!! Hold on to your seats - you're going to die for these pickles!!!!\nOMG! This place!",

Lived in Culverland for 20 years and never had the urge to go here, but friend wanted to go -- sooooo....\n\nWhile I'm not strict health food or vegan, I like to eat more 21st century -- eg, main dish salad, nothing deep fried (which flies in the face of the \"fries with everything\" ethos here), veggies (do the pickles count?)   Reconsidering, the pickles were the healthiest and best-tasting thing on the table.  \n\nEight dollars for a half pastrami san, nothing else on the plate?? and it was mediocre pastrami.  $12.95 for a burger my friend called  \"nothing special\", with fries and slaw.  To be fair the slaw was homestyle, and not slimy like many factory-produced slaws.\n\nThis place, and Tito's Tacos,  leave me puzzled.  Culver City institutions??? waiting on line in the street for so-so fast food?  My guess -- baby boomers recapturing high school memories, after all, neither of these places has remodeled or upgraded their offerings since the mid-fifties. Have to ask my east coast soul, if someone opened a corner candy store and offered sugary soda fountain faves, and even cheap unwrapped candy, would I beat a path to that?\n\nHmm, I think not.",

Maybe because I'm so anxious to get this amazing pastrami sandwich that I forget to tell Yelpers about it. Now to be honest I do remember it being a little different. But the change is good for those who think it might be too soggy or salty when they serve it French dipped style. They used to put pickles on it for you and drench it in the Au Jus & serve you extra pickles on the side. Now they serve the Au Jus on the side as well as the pickles. There's a nice patio seating area on both sides of the old cafe style building with a fire pit. One side is covered and provides a nice shelter from the rain or wind and then if you'd like there's booth & bar style seating inside.",

Once we moved away she would travel over an hour just for a pastrami sandwich. I remember when I was a child the sandwiches were $8 now they are over $15 if you add cheese!! That is why I had to deduct one star. It is really expensive now but yes they do give you enough pastrami for two people and the pickles are amazing. Now that I live less than a mile away I have the ability to try more items on their menu but somehow I still only get the pastrami and fries LOL.\n\nMy only compliant is they still only take cash ONLY. No cards. I feel like they can pay a lil bank fee with how much they are charging for their sandwiches lol Also, parking is horrible.\n\nIf you are ever in West LA you should most definitely stop by and see what the hype is about!",

While I usually prefer thicker deli style pastrami like at Langer's, Johnnie's is quite possibly the best thin-cut pastrami sandwich I've had anywhere.  Yup, it's that good.\n\nTheir secret?  It's that damn dipping sauce.  It adds so much flavor to the sandwich.  While the hot pastrami is already dipped in it, you must must must ask for extra.  Dipping every bite seriously takes the sandwich to another level.\n\nAt $11.25 per sandwich (with cheese), Johnnie's is definitely not cheap eats.  But trust me, it's worth it.  Be careful with the hot mustard.  No shortage of kick there.\n\n4.5 Stars\nPastrami goodness\nHot Pastrami with Swiss",

After seeing how much those first 2 items are, your ass is drinking water cause a small drink is probably $10.\n4. After being ass raped for said cheeseburger and fries, you're expecting some gourmet shit. But wait derrs more.\n5. Cheeseburger ends up being a bun with lettuce, onion wad, and frozen meat disk. Not even any mayo, ketchup, etc (normal cheeseburger shit).\n5. Cheap ass crinkle cut fast food style fries that  you could have bought at Del Taco.

The 1950's era d\u00e9cor just tickles me and they have a few autographed pictures of celebrities. Being at Johnnie's just makes you feel pretty damn good. Eagerly, I ordered the specialty, a French Dip Pastrami sandwich. Now, before I explain my experience, I have realized of late that it's important to be responsible with critical reviews and not be unnecessarily negative or petty. So, with that being said, I'm going to be as kind as possible. I love this establishment because it's a family-owned mom and pops place. We need more places like this.  At one time, places like this were pretty ubiquitous and we didn't fully appreciate them. Greasy spoons. Dive restaurants. To find an original, and to visually experience the crowd's devotion and contentment, it just cheered me up right away and really made me happy I had come. So, any nit-picking, take with a grain of salt. I could be totally wrong. Besides, what I may not like, the majority of Culvercitians may love.\n\nI only tried the pastrami, so that's all I can rate. Well, the pastrami was 50/50 meat and fat. It was thinly shaved pastrami that, because of all the fat, it looked like piles of raw bacon. Pastrami is fatty to a degree, as it should be to withstand the process of becoming pastrami. But if it is properly cured, rubbed, smoked, and finally steamed, it really shouldn't look like raw, thinly sliced, undercooked bacon. I'm coming with knowledge of the east coast experience and such places as Katz's Deli that has been pumping out pastrami for 125 years, or the irreplaceable Carnegie Deli, two excellent examples. The pastrami is thick, delicious, and mostly lean with a bit of visible fat here and there. Now, since the meat seemed like something other than traditional pastrami, it all kind of went downhill as a sandwich for me - - but maybe this is just a personal thing. The bread was good but they dip the bread for you a la Philippe's, although you can barely taste this because it's barely dipped. If like me you are used to ordering a side of au jus or getting a soggy but delicious double-dip from Philippe's, this will probably be a negative. I tried to enjoy the sandwich, but I kept staring at all the fat and I could not bring myself to take more than 2 or 3 bites. Johnnie's has been in business since 1952, so maybe there's more to this place than meets the eye. One sandwich and 2 iced teas ran me about $20.00, and this is a cash only establishment. If I come back, I will probably explore other items on the menu. I don't own a restaurant but I imagine it is impossible to make everyone happy. I also cringe at the idea of the owner reading this review because besides this one thing, there are hundreds of other things the owner must be doing perfectly to have such a packed, happy house. So, maybe my issues are just that - my issues. This is a great little place with tons of charm and a great staff. They have a fire pit under the outside patio, and that alone made me want to come back after sundown. I'm still going to give this place a great rating, because I bet their hotdogs and burgers are fantastic. I will definitely come back, I just won't order the pastrami. Oh, and I am a pickle junkie. Everybody gets a complimentary cup of sliced pickles. Yum. I ate all of them.",

For anyone who has never tasted a Langer's Deli sandwich this place is quite good. For anyone who has, you already know where I'm going with this.\n\nThe sandwiches are very substantial and filling which makes them perfect for a meal at any time of day. The pastrami itself is not the softest, but has good texture, even though for me it was a tad too salty. The bread is nothing to rave about, but gets the job done.\n\nThe place itself has a lot of nice features like outdoor seating, a fire pit, parking, and pleasant servers. One big downfall, is that it is cash only.",

They were crunchy and yummy   definitely would want these again...except for the fact that there was a long piece of hair fried onto my onion ring.... it was extremely disgusting. I was peeling the hair out of the fried part and it was stuck inside the batter and made a noise as it ripped out. Again I did like the taste of the onion rings but definitely disgusted by that one. I know it could be a 1 time thing but you can't have that. That's sick\n\nNow onto the pastrami. I was so excited to try this guy. It was good sized. Cheesy. But unfortunately. It completely lacked the flavor I expected. It was dry and not that good... I'm no pastrami expert but I' have had langers. Tops. And the hat.  And those 3 places BY FAR taste better to me in MY opinion. I could JUST ear the pastrami with no sauce or bun and it would be delicious.  This on the other hand failed to be as good.\n\nI can't comment on service because I had this for pick up  but I was disappointed. Meh is a good description for the food. (and lookout for hairs fried in the rings)\n\nOh and the pickles were great!",

                  "review": "So, oops.  I just realized that the review I posted on 9/17/2012 was posted to the Johnny's Pastrami page (note different spelling), and this is the one that I meant.  So I'm posting it here, because they deserve it.  :)  The other one is closed now, anyway.\n\nLast night the hubs was shocked to hear that the native Angelino had never been to Johnny's and immediately asked me out on a lunch date to go there.  We went today.\n\nOrder: two pastrami sandwiches, one chili cheese fry, a coke, and a glass of water.  (Because I'm weaning away from coke)\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nIt was a lovely day to sit outside.  This is more of a greasy spoon pastrami sandwich than a Jewish deli pastrami sandwich.  They only take cash.\n\nPickles as an appetizer.  PICKLES.  On par with Roll n Rye pickles.  OMG.  PICKLES!!!!\n\nI would never have thought to get the chili cheese fries until I noticed that EVERY SINGLE TABLE had them.  They were delicious.  The only negative on my end was that they were a little light on onion bits, but I was too busy stuffing them in my mouth to ask our waitress for more.  The hubs prefers thiner fries and wasn't thrilled with the chili.  He's wrong, of course.\n\nThe sandwich?  Thinly sliced pastrami and bread.   That's all.  There is mustard on the table and they'll bring spiced mustard if you ask.  It's very simple.  The meat, however, is incredible.\n\nOur waitress was incredibly talented at loading up on sandwiches for other patrons.  She was friendly and knowledgable, and checked in with us without being overbearing.  A real pro!\n\nI only ate half my sandwich, and if it's still in the fridge tomorrow (the hubs stays up late and sometimes likes to snack...), I'll take it to work for lunch.  $11 may seem like a lot for a sandwich, but I am here to tell you that it's worth it.\n\nI would totally go back.",

WTF? Friends of mine in Los Angeles are saying right now \"BurgerDogBoy, you ate pastrami?! You HATE pastrami!\".\n\nNot true folks. It's just a little secret I keep close to the vest. I can't help but love Johnnie's, it was born the same year I was, and I have an affinity for things like that. I once owned a Seeburg Jukebox from the same year. Sweet. Just like me. Ran like clockwork. Mostly. Occasionally needed parts. Just like me.\n\nJohnnie's occupies a marvelous corner, there's a really shady hotel kitty-korner that I have had occasion to use an hour or two - and next door is Cinco de Mayo, the all night Mexican joint I have written about before - and behind that, the Los Angeles beloved Tito's Tacos. You could eat six meals a day and never leave this street corner.\n\nJohnnie's is open late, and has some cool outdoor seating with firepits. On this day, I plopped my large derriere at the counter, ordered the dip and a side of chili fries. Ah, there's that familiar chili again. Could it be Vienna? There's a Vienna clock on the wall here. Hmmmm.\n\nI could only get through half the sandwich, having gorged myself on free pickles aforehand. Yummy, crisp dill chunks.\n\nCould the true test of the worth of a sandwich be much the same as my test for pizza? How is it the next morning after being left out on the counter all night? Or in the case of the pastrami, how is it the next day after being left on the seat of the car all night?\n\nUnfrickin' believable. What a great breakfast.\n\nCheck out Johnnie's the next time you are in L.A.  Yes, they have burgers and dogs.  Cash only, but ATM on site.\nPastrami Dip and Chili Fries",

Oh dear God, I cried a little (in joy) when I ate my first bite of pastrami.  I really had a moment that was just WOW.  I like other pastrami places, right, but dude, there is just no comparison with Johnnies.  It was freaking amazing!\n\nThe bathroom situation is still a very serious problem.  By the time I arrived, I had to go, daddio, and I waited.  Like for ten minutes I was doing a freaking pee dance in the parking lot!  There I am, just dancing and pacing like a complete and total freak-show waiting for the john to open-up.  The whole time, in moment-by-moment increments, my mind is wondering what in God's name this dude is doing in there while simultaneously wondering what kind of toxic waste mess he'll likely leave.  Finally, the door opens, and it's this totally nice looking guy with a little kid.  Oops.  Sorry there dad (and kid).  I didn't mean to be cursing and pounding on the door so much.  I just really really had to go and you all took like 10-minutes!  It's Johnnie's fault but we don't blame them because we like their food too much!\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n8/23/2012Previous review\nPROS:  The food is awesome.  The atmosphere is dumpy, but in a totally fun and unique way.  Nobody would ever want the atmosphere to change.  I've probably eaten here 50-times in my life and overall I love the place.  It's open really late (like 3:30 am on the weekends.)  The pastrami is great, the onion rings are great, burger, fries, chili-fries, hot-dog, you name it!  \n\nCONS:  Cash only.  Parking can at times be difficult.  Seating at times can be difficult.  Bathrooms need help.",

                  "review": "-- Johnnie's is one of a dwindling number of truly old-school eateries still operating in the L.A. area. And for this reason, the place is special. It was built in 1952, and for the most part it still looks the way it did back then. It's basically a cube-shaped box with a red-and-white neon sign over the front. The tiny kitchen is in the center, booths line the outer edge on 3 sides, and a counter abuts the kitchen area on 2 sides, with backless stools. The cash register is an original, time-worn manual one; when's the last time your restaurant bill/receipt wasn't computer-printed? Milk shakes are made by hand on an old mixer, which takes extra time and requires human attention, but produces the real thing, not soft-serve. Two over-50 ladies handle the customers, and they seem like they've been working there for decades, and love it. The service they provide is so much better than what you get from a student who works part-time while his/her mind is fixated on other things. You can truly enjoy your meal knowing that you are eating mostly great food with great service in an old-time place that's steeped in tradition.\n-- The reason I'm not giving 5 stars overall is simply because the prices are now so much higher than the last time I ate there several years ago. (I now live over 15 miles away and no longer have a car.) I only ordered 3 items: the full-size hot pastrami dip sandwich (their signature dish), a side of french fries, and a shake. But with tax and a 15% tip, the total cost was $31!! Yikes! That was more than I planned on spending. But it's entirely possible that these higher prices are necessary for the place to stay in business. Property owners are usually businessmen who care only about making money hand-over-fist and don't care about tradition or historical preservation.\n-- The pastrami in the sandwich was plentiful, tender, and very tasty. The meat was my slightly preferred kind: sliced very thin, with ample fat, cut into curly narrow pieces. There was so much meat that it was constantly falling out of the sides of the sandwich. The jus came piping-hot in a little cup for dipping instead of being pre-poured on the sandwich roll, which is better, as the bread doesn't get too soggy. The only reason I'm not rating the whole thing a 5.0 is because the roll isn't 1st-rate; it would be better if it were a crisper roll like a Dutch Krunch.\n-- The fries were just the standard zigzag-cut long fries like you can find in a zillion places around town. Not great, but good enough.\n-- I wanted to get a drink that would reflect the true 1950's experience, and I was also in the mood for something creamy, so I ordered the root beer float, blended shake-style. It was a winner. Tasted great! While they do make it in an old-style large silver metal cup, instead of pouring most of it into a standard old 12-oz sundae glass and giving you the metal cup containing the remainder, they just put it all in a large paper milkshake cup, with a long plastic ice cream spoon so you can either drink it, or savor it by eating just a spoonful at a time. The flavor was a nice break from the same-old same-old chocolate, vanilla or strawberry. (Also, using soda instead of milk in the shake makes for better digestion.)\n-- Perhaps most folks can't patronize Johnnie's on a regular basis now because of the cost, but I'd like to see a lot of us drop by every so often to ensure that this old gem stays in business for decades to come.",

                  "review": "Pastrami, to me, is the food of the gods. After moving to the westside from the SGV, I've been searching for a pastrami joint that is up to par with the Hat. After browsing Yelp, I stumbled upon Johnnie's Pastrami, and reading through the reviews and looking through the pictures, I was extremely hopeful that I had found a great pastrami joint on the westside.\n\nI had read the reviews, and I was prepared for the high prices (as long as the taste justified the price). However, I was sorely disappointed at my pastrami sandwich. I do enjoy my pastrami sliced thinly, but the pastrami was so SO bland. I've given Johnnie's multiple chances, and I still can't get over how bland the meat is. If I'm missing what makes this pastrami great, then somebody please let me know! The bread is good, and the hot mustard that you can put on the sandwich is also good. Usually I don't put too much mustard on my sandwich, but without it, you wouldn't be able to taste a thing...\n\nDespite the sandwich being extremely so-so, the fries here are really good. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle cut fries because I associate crinkle cut with sad frozen supermarket fries, but the fries here are fried to perfection. The onion rings here are also decent as well, but they're nothing to really write home about. The complimentary pickles given to you at the beginning of the meal are pretty good, but that's probably because I love pickles.\n\nA meal here, assuming you get a whole sandwich and a side of fries, will set you back around 20 bucks short. Now, I'm not usually one to complain about prices since living on the westside has made me immune to unreasonably high prices for everything...but 20 dollars for a unsatisfying lunch is just waaaaaay too much.\n\nThis place isn't terrible by any means. It's a pretty iconic landmark in Culver City, and the interior is definitely cool - taking you back in time. However, I don't see myself dishing out 20 bucks for a pastrami dip meal when I can get a much better sandwich at the Hat. I'll just save my pastrami cravings until I find time to drive all the way out to the SGV.",

Since we're off to conquer pastrami land that week,  we ventured the 15 mi drive in search of the best.  This place is not a miss at all.   I adore the setting and ambiance.  It's a little piece of the old LA. The mini jukeboxes on each table and the signs that brings you back to the 50's.  Interior is a small setting, but they do extend on both sides outdoors picnic style.\n\nWe tried the Pastrami French Dip and it tasted good.  Definitely some long hours of cooking and delicate slicing. (I did wonder where the dip was. Still prefer Langer's because there's no struggle at all in every bite.) The sandwich surely has the get-all-over-the-place factor.   Even comes with a fork on the side to help maneuver each succulent bite.  They do serve beer, but the one thing that stood out was the strawberry shake.  It was a cute tower of creamy strawberry flavor with light hints of unmixed vanilla ice cream. There's a very slight icy grainy texture, but it could just be from the freezing process.    Yes, I finished the shake with my half of a sandwich and the other part to take home.   So don't hesitate to visit Johnnie's Pastrami to get your pastrami on.   They can make it happen.",

Years later I would find out that, that wasn't the case. Ladies and Gentleman, I give you Johnnie's Pastrami Restaurant!!\n\nNestled on Sepulveda right off Washington Blvd in Culver City, Johnnie's is most notably across the street from the famous Tito's Taco's.\n\nI do not know what times are more crowded than others, I always seem to get a table anytime, but I am sure there are times where it is more crowded.\n\nAnyway you sit down in a small but cozy diner, (there are two covered patios also) and have the all too familiar but severely lacking (in most restaurants) old school diner feel. This place has been around since 1952!! So if definitely is the real deal. You can choose your favorite classic song from the jukebox and enjoy a nice cold soda pop.\n\nThe waitresses are all older ladies, who obviously have all been working there for many years. They give you a delicious bowl of pickles on the house with your meal.\n\nThere are several menu items to choose from, but why get anything else. Go with the Original! (it's in the name!!)\n\nThe hot pastrami sandwich.. I like it on Rye. The onion rings and French fries are delicious too!\n\nFirst bite into this succulent delicious sandwich will leave your taste buds begging for more.. And trust me you will get more. Johnnie definitely doesn't skimp out on pastrami. These sandwiches are MASSIVE!\n\nIf your with a lady or you are a small eater.. You could share one probably.. (But hey leftover Johnnies is pretty baller too)\n\nJohnnies Pastrami is a great place for lunch, dinner whatever! And its family friendly. Introduce your little one to the Best Pastrami Sandwich in LA\n\n**Pro Tip**\n\nCash only guys! Bring some money.. Also there is an ATM by Tito's.\n\nFood - 5/5\nService - 5/5\nAtmosphere - 3/5\nPrice - $10-$15 a person\nParking - Free in the back",

Anyways the reviews were pretty stellar so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nWhat you get is a small looking diner.  The atmosphere is cool, it teleports you back to a time when you think you should be wearing a leather jacket, grease backed hair and atight white t-shirt.  Service is prompt and friendly.  They have an extensive diner menu with all your regular diner options but as the name goes, the star of the restaurant is the pastrami sandwich.\n\nI basically asked them to hook me up with the \"house special\" if you will, their most popular pastrami item.  Out came this massive pastrami sandwich which is more than enough for one person.  If you take a look at the photos, it looks amazing.  However, it stops at the looks itself.  The meat is essentially flavorless.  It's strange because it's so rich in color, however, it was borderline bland.  Pastrami usually has a saltiness on the heavier side, due to a brining process but this didn't have any of that.  They also gave you a spicy mustard, which I used to slather over the whole thing, but once again, the mustard lacked any tartness, it just had a strange sensation of heat without any distinctive mustard flavor.  Everything was very odd to me.  There was a side of pickles and these were delicious.\n\nIf you are looking for pickles, this is the place to go.  If you are looking for a pastrami sandwich, I would keep looking.",

And last week this is what I was treated to, I read a lot of the reviews and honestly all I can say is wow to my friends from Los Angeles. Regardless of the price, reputation, etc. a diner is always going to be a diner. Plain and simple, if you cannot grasp that concept then really guys stick to the national chains I think you will be happier there.\n\nThe food is decent, I mean you're looking for pastrami in LA so you can't really expect the same taste as a NYC or CHI pastrami, but for what it is was not bad at all. The fries were good and the onion rings were perfect for my taste. But it certainly is a no non-sense 50's diner atmosphere and worth going to check it out, unless of course you are looking for a modern dining experience. I would recommend this place for visitors and locals alike, especially visitors as this place has a great vibe and character that gets lost in many cities, yet somehow manages to thrive in LA. A very nice way to take a step back in time.",

                  "review": "Have you ever ordered chili cheese fries to-go and it comes in a pink one-dozen donut box? Well, that's what you will get at Johnnie's Pastrami. An order of chili cheese fries can cost you a pretty penny but you do get a huge portion. I love that their chili has nice chunks of meat rather than just a bunch of unidentified mush. I love having it with their ranch dressing.\n\nI didn't try their pastrami but I heard that The Hat on the East side is much better. I will have to check it out some time.\n\nI ordered a chocolate shake that costs $5 and it came out in a small cup. I thought the shake tasted quite amazing but the price was ridiculous. Everything they sell is pretty expensive and they take cash only.",

                  "review": "In a quaint little diner, a jukebox is playing classic diner music, slices of pie are displaying on the countertop, and a warm and inviting aroma of savory pastrami greets you as you enter.  I knew I found a place that I will be coming back to over and over again.  \n\nI ordered the pastrami deluxe plate.  The pastrami was perfectly seasoned and quite balanced with the hot mustard.    The pastrami meat was shaved thinly and laid on top of a french roll.  This was comfort food.  The server offered hot peppers as well to go with the meal, which were hot and addicting.  The french fries were average crinkle cut fries and the coleslaw was nothing to brag about.  So maybe next time I will just order the sandwich and maybe one of those slices of pie on display.  \n\nThe only negative was the cost of the meal.  About $15.95 for a sandwich, fries, and coleslaw.  A bit steep for me for just a sandwich.  \n\nThe only pastrami sandwich I had better was in NY at Katz deli, but Johnnie's is an enjoyable place for pastrami on the west coast.",

I also think she's been working there a few decades, so could ya blame her?\n\nThe pastrami is good. Not the best I've had, but still good. Not as salty as I remembered it being the first time I ventured into Johnny's. The onion rings were quite good too. Chilli cheese dog was ok. The hot dog was a bit over cooked. Over all an ok meal for everyone. I don't think anyone was actually disappointed. They have a poor selection on beers though.\n\nThe best part of the place are the little jukebox machines on each table. $0.25 for 2 songs. Most being oldies but goodies and some random songs you wouldn't expect in that selection. We all had a good time after our usually Bigfoot run. Not running back here anytime soon, but we may end up here again someday.",

The meat is moist and tender and they pack it on a very tasty french roll.  Don't forget the spicy mustard!  Beyond that, my young daughter decided to order the fried shrimp.

The sandwiches were expensive, and there was nothing there that I couldn't get somewhere else, cheaper and less greasy.\n\nOn the plus side, if you like kitchy, greasy spoons, I suppose it could be fun.  If you like people-watching, the wait-staff (all women) and the cooks (all men) were characters worthy of notice.\n\nTwo final warnings: you can't pay with credit, and you can't eat outside by yourself during lunch.",

And sometimes a milkshake.\n\nNice little jukeboxes on the tables, served with deli pickles (good but not my fave pickle) on the table.

We'll not exactly, but definitely after getting the bob's special corn beef, my perception of pastrami (& corn beef) was instantly changed.  \n\nYou know how when you hit the lotto for 245 million dollars and your favorite celebrity gives you a shout out live on television in one day?  Well it wasn't like that, but I'm sure if that did happen, it'd be pretty damn close.  \n\nAll the other foods on the menu here are... well on the menu, but definitely get the corn beef.\n\nThe pickles are perfectly crunchy and the sodas have crushed ice in it, which instantly chills the soda with all that surface area.  The waiters are chill as hell.\n\nThe only downside is the \"Nothing but cash\" rule, so swing by the ATM and grab some or you're going have to pay that retarded $2 convenience fee with the ATM outside.  If you're still going around LA without cash in your pockets, then I'm sure you the inconvenience has been engrained in your head yet.. cash is king.\n\nI definitely recommend this place.",

The pastrami is really thin and very tasty.  The service was great and parking was easy.  The fries are crinkle cut which remind me of good memories of childhood.

It's nice to sit outside near one of the fire pits or if your inside, treat yourself to a good 60's tune on the small jukeboxes at every table (I'm actually one of the people that uses them).  The crinkle cut fries are good and there's something about the pickles they give out with every meal that's better then average. One thing I don't like is that they are not open super late anymore which is a shame because it was a good late night place. So, don't just drive by it when your hungry next time because Pauly says -- good stuff!",

Their bar top and tables are vintage and so are some of their waitresses, who have been there since the restaurant opened doors. While the food is not fancy, it's satisfying. My favorites are the charbroiled hot dog, onion rings and chocolate shake. Their famous pastrami sandwich is also pretty good- not the best I have had, but close. There are a lot of nice little touches, including the fire pits outside and the metal dish of sour pickles they bring you as soon as you sit down. Johnnie's is a special place because it takes you back to a different time. The diner is one of the few in Culver City that's open past 1am (open til 3am Saturday) which is awesome for me since my boyfriend is part vampire and enjoys late night dining.",

The pastrami is tender and juicy, and even though I don't really like mustard these sandos MAKE me like it.  There isn't a whole lot to say about Johnnie's... it's simple, cheap, and delicious.  5 stars for the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had.

But there was one major thing wrong with my dining experience at Akasha that you should know about in advance:  they have the most uncomfortable dining chairs you may ever sit in.\n\nUnless you are seated at the bar or along the center banquette, the regular dining chairs are open at the base and make it feel like your ass is hanging out, and they don't give you proper support for your back.\n\nI don't care how old you are, those chairs are just awful and make the dining experience fairly miserable.  I'm amazed they were approved by management.",

I adore the concept of seasonal + sustainable ingredients, as well as the trio seating areas--caf\u00e9, bar and dining room--but the food hasn't impressed me much. I've dined at Akasha twice and left feeling full, but uninspired to share passionate food stories (which I normally do when I'm in love with a place).\n\nIt's average tasting food, on the higher price spectrum, presented beautifully, in my kind of restaurant ambience, and lovely service.\n\nMaybe I've ordered the wrong things. I've tried three entrees and although it's impressing presentation, but not satisfying in taste.\n- QUINOA & SUNFLOWER SEED VEGGIE BURGER, $14: I love burgers. Beef, turkey, Portobello, veggie patties--I don't discriminate. I was sold on this veggie burger when I learned that Akasha's veggie pattie is house-made. It was a soft bun hugging avocado, caramelized onion, smoke paprika aioli, red onion, gruyere and the quinoa and a sunflower seed pattie. It would have been a good burger if it wasn't destroyed by heavy hand servings of salt. I enjoyed the texture, presentation, except it was heavily salty. No amount of water or internal convincing could get me to finish it. It had good flavor, but the salt was too intense. I hardly return items to the kitchen, but I finished a tough morning spin class and I was hungry. So I spoke up Our server was so kind to let me order another item from the menu. I'm willing to try the veggie burger again... maybe?\n- CHILE SHRIMP, $18: Think chopped romaine greens sprinkled with feta cheese, avocado, cucumber, tomato, kalamata olives, red onion, lemon vinaigrette and spicy + flavorful shrimp (but also overly salted for my taste). This salad is not for the salt adverse, considering there's feta cheese, olives and salty shrimp.\n\nService: Friendly and attentive. Our server was incredibly accommodating and was able to handle our group of 6 people.\n\nParking: Two-hour free parking is available in a public lot on Watseka Avenue, behind the restaurant, with additional public parking and metered spaces within a 5-minute walk.\n\nI'm willing to come back, maybe for brunch where I'll feast on Intelligentsia coffee, hearty breakfast foods and their gorgeously displayed baked goods.",

I haven't been to the Culver City side much before and I was visiting my friend in SoCal! So I decided to book a reservation just to have something under the belt in case we didn't have time to make a reservation later. They were able to book me a table for 4 at 7:30pm and the hostess said they were pretty booked the rest of the night unless I wanted to wait for the bar. Nah, we'll take the 7:30 even though I wanted a little earlier. It ended up working out time-wise and I'm glad we had a table reserved! There's parking in the structure behind the building so you could enter from the back door if you park in there.\n\nThe whole ambiance of the place was really nice. It had a modern/rustic yet industrial look with the lights and a beautiful looking patio outside. It would have made for a nice romantic dinner for two as well. We started with an heirloom tomato salad and a fig/prosciutto/arugula flatbread. The tomato salad was nothing really special and kind of overpriced IMO. I liked the flatbread, but again...also something I probably could have made at home if I really wanted to.\n\nFor the entrees, two of us got the trout ($28) which smelled and looked amazing from our neighbors that ordered it. I was a huge fan of this and this was my favorite part of the whole night. Crispy textures, smooth, soft insides topped with crispy wispy onions on a bed of roasted veggies and a lovely pesto sauce...the whole thing was just awesome. Other entrees ordered were the sea bass--also delicious but more of a tomato-y sauce, as well as the seafood thai curry which was peppered with mussels/clams and had a little kick to it. I would hands down order that trout again!\n\nWe also ordered a peach \"hand pie\" for dessert accompanied with vanilla ice cream. It's basically a peach empanada...and I was not too impressed. However, our waiter was great and service was friendly. He even picked up that we had a birthday without us telling him and asked me in secrecy which lady it was so he could add a birthday candle to the dessert.\n\nAll in all, the food was either really good or just okay, but I'd come back to try more if I could!",

                  "review": "I can't say I was terribly impressed with this place, especially after reading all the glowing reviews. Let me start by saying the service was NOT the problem, our waiter was attentive and helpful.\n\nThe problem was actually the mediocre food. We went at lunch which you could argue might not be the best time to go, but still, it should still be good in my opinion.\n\nMy friend and I split the albacore lettuce cups to begin. Some good here, mostly not so much. First, the good: The curried cashews/toasted coconut shavings meant to be put on the lettuce cups was delicious, as was the sauce also meant to augment the cups. Now the bad: The fish portion was meager in comparison to the price, and when you combined the fish with the lettuce and the toppings the resulting little \"sandwich\" was pretty bland thanks to the overwhelming portions of everything besides the fish (and the curry mix). So far not so good.\n\nSecond my friend had the steak salad and I had the turkey burger. The steak salad was ok i guess, with the exception of the STEAK. The meat was horribly chewy and tough, so much so that i got in the dreaded position of having this hunk of meat in my mouth that was over-chewed but impossible to swallow due to still being tough. I hate that.\n\nThen there is the burger. I was aflutter after reading that there was jalepenos or something in the ground turkey, as I live for something spicy. When it got to my plate I took a look and I was very underwhelmed. It just looked....boring. I took a bite and was not surprised at the blah-ness. It just wasn't exciting in looks or taste, and it was teeny-tiny. To add insult to injury the sweet-potato fries, a major addiction of mine, were soggy and not well-seasoned. I guess I got what I deserve, I should know that if I want a good burger and SP fries I shoulda headed down the street to Father's Office. They have great fries there.\n\nFinally I think this very middling food does not warrant the high prices. I suppose I'm paying for the location etc. but I think the finished product should be better. Maybe I went on an off day, but I do not know if I would go back for fear of more of the same.\n\nSorry Akasha, I just expected more!",

A staunch omnivore, I avoided anything that had the word \"vegetarian\" or \"seitan\" in it -- is it really a coincidence that seitan and Satan sound similar? -- although I know that is what Akasha Richmond is known for.  \n\nThe decor and ambiance the place is going for seems to be stuck in this purgatory between fine and casual dining, industrial and homey, which didn't really do it for me.  The bakery side was too big and sparse to be a bakery (same reason I prefer the old Boule to Boule Atelier).  \n\nMy company happened to be two of my good, good friends, so overall I would say I had a pleasant experience.

Very raw and earthy with all the wood and I loved the overall openness of the dining room.\n\nFor dinner I had the Flat Iron Steak & a small portion of the fish special of the day. The steak was was well cooked, but nothing extremely special or memorable. However all those who had ordered the fish RAVED about it - shows that the chef has respect and care for fresh in season ingredients.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a wide array to get a sampling - but whatever you do you MUST order the Peanut Butter Bar!!! I'm not a HUGE fan of PB, but OHMYGOSH I loved it! Plus as an add bonus for all you special eaters out there...it's VEGAN, but you would have NEVER known unless I told you.\n\nWill definitely come back for more AKASHA cocktails, beets, and pb bars!",

No complaints about the service either.  \n\nI had to schedule a dinner with special friends and I immediately thought of Akasha as the location.  I looked up the restaurant for the first time on Yelp so I could forward the info to my friends.  I was horrified to see all the bad reviews!!  I double checked to make sure I hadn't clicked on the wrong restaurant.  Unfortunately all the reviews were for the restaurant I thought was good.  Hmmm... what to do?  Change the location?  I decided against changing the location to our dinner and instead thought I would be super alert to their service and hope that we would get lucky.\n\nFortunately all my fears were unfounded.  The hostess, the waitress, and the busboys were all great!  The food was amazing and was out on our table in a timely manner.  Towards the end of our meal I came clean to my friends and told them about what I read on Yelp.  They were very surprised since their experience at Akasha had been wonderful so far.  \n\nI understand that there are bad \"apples\" at every place of business.  I hope that the owners / management at Akasha read the horrible reviews on Yelp and took them seriously enough to get rid of the bad employees.  \n\nGoing to Akasha again tonight for another special dinner.  I'm hoping that my wonderful experience is repeated. :-)",

We ordered a regular mojito and a pumpkin pie martini and they were both delicious.\n\nWe started with the chicken tikki spiced wings and they were delicious.  There was a nectarine and mint chutney, two delicious dipping sauces for the wings.  \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Australian sea bass  which was prepared nicely.  The fish was flaky and tasted great.  It was in a tomato, chorizo broth.  It was a very generous portion.  My bf ordered the Niman ranch burger it was heavenly.  The burger was juicy and the sweet potato fries were nice and crispy.\n\nLast but not least, for dessert we had the salty chocolate peanut butter!!! Ohmigod this thing was sooooo good I couldn't believe it.  It was candied peanuts, peanut butter chocolate chunk gelato, sea salt and caramel.  The best part was that it was vegan.  There was no dairy in this dessert.  This dessert is definitely a must-have.  I will definitely be back.",

Great design and overall ambiance.  The service was very good and coupled with some very good open table offers we will be back.\n\nThe ginger drop cocktail, pork sliders, and flat iron steak were excellent (especially the steak, which had a great preparation with an especially tasty chimichurri sauce and two delicious sides).\n\n**The following is mostly for any Akasha staff who may be reading this, please take the following into consideration**\n\nThe only part that nearly ruined the whole evening was the Australian sea bass.  I applaud the chef's attempt to create a unique preparation (especially his use of chorizo) but this dish just fell flat.  Unfortunately bland, overcooked, and just very much out of place within the rest of the meal, this dish should have been sent back, but we felt awkward doing so.  I would highly recommend updating your sea bass dish and trying again.\n\nI am just thankful the rest of the meal was so good, so we didn't have to write this place off.",

I admit I have a salt addiction, but I worried from the outset that this would be an undersalted restaurant. It was.\n\nNot a problem usually, but when you give me undercooked macaroni and cheese in a precious tiny cast iron pan and forget to add salt, it messes with my groove. I ordered the vegetable stack (which was awesome: \"macadamia nut cheese,\" eggplant, tomato, spinach, roasted pepper, market vegetables, cauliflower puree, balsamic reduction.\nDad got the scallops (5 stars if I had only gotten those). Only 2 as it was a side.\n\nFish: excellent!!!!\nMacaroni and cheese: again, almost there, but perhaps worth the $8 if you're in range of salt and pepper + ketchup.\nLimited beer list: 3 on tap, only about 5 predictable bottles.\n\nWine list= off the hook, and half off wednesdays. Sundays has NO CORKAGE FEE, which is really one of a kind in LA.\n\nAtmosphere: Open and well lit though chairs are awful (4 inches too low), and booths are flat-backed as though one mustn't relax.",

I don't think I was racist, just confused by the name on the many occasions I passed it over cuz I was in the mood for a burger - and then when I finally went there I had a very good burger. Big points for the fresh/local menu [including homemade ketchup], as well as a great selection of wines and cocktails. Maybe not as tasty as Ford's, but the food is good and the DJ spins great tunes at a reasonable volume [unlike the deafening Rush Street].",

Yes, it's a little pretentious and often ungodly busy, but their bartenders, chefs, and waitstaff are all consummate professionals who make the experience worthwhile. The happy hour is a good deal, with a number of discounted cocktails and bar food, while dinner can get a little bit pricey. Do yourself a favor and get an order of the onion rings, no matter what else you're eating - they are divinely crunchy, served with a smokey and just-a-little-bit spicy dipping sauce that makes them the best onion rings you didn't make yourself, and they're vegan to boot!",

The Hummus and Pita was the best I think I've had, although I've never been to Morocco. The fried artichoke was pretty good and worth a try. Definitely high on my list of LA restaurants/ wine bars.

I really should have checked yelp, but I think I preferred to go in with blinders on.\n\nClue number 1. The hostess was on a personal call and wouldn't make eye contact. Then finally raised a finger to keep us waiting a little longer.\n\nWent with a friend after a particularly successful day and wanted to celebrate a little. Mistake. I had the steak salad and he had the burger. The  boston lettuce wasn't over dressed, but the oil left my tongue feeling lardy. The steak was cut along the grain and was stringy and chewy. The seasoning, just ok, not remarkable. The burger was red and mushy. He's a man's man, so he just ate it anyway, but confessed it was just ok as well. And he wouldn't want to eat there again.\n\nI thought the meal could be saved by the dessert menu. mmmmmmmmm, not so much. There was nothing on it to speak of. Ho Hum. So we left and went a couple doors down to Ugo. Now they have a bakery where we had a delightful finish.",

It came presliced and marinated to perfection. My lady got the pork chop which was also great. Plus they gave us cupcakes since it was our anniversary. Our total bill was 89, which is a bit pricey, but I was happy with the food. Highly recommend.",

Two friends from the East Coast came to visit and so I decided to show them the new places coming up near me. Took them to Akasha and we happened to meet the head chef Sean-something (sorry, blanking on the last name),TOTALLY HOT, just so you know. He was really cool and even made some suggestions for us to share for the whole table. We ordered the lamb sliders, this really TASTY soba dish with a sushi style kampachi, flat iron steak (weird name, but apparently a common cut of steak nowadays), onion rings, mac and cheese. The little lamb sliders were KILLER!! The sushi and soba dish was so good, nice and refreshing. The steak was also very tasty, they were even able to cook half of it more well done than the other half as we requested since one of us (I won't say names...jamie) doesn't like too much pink. The onion rings were really good as i remember them from before. And the mac and cheese was okay, nothing fantastic, but it's organic so i guess i should feel good about that at least. If we had thought about it before we left, we should have bought the hot chef with the hot hair a glass of wine or a nice cocktail for all the good suggestions. Next time, I promise!! The dining room gets pretty loud but we didn't mind, and our server was pretty lame but the good food and the hottie in the kitchen more than makes up for it. I wonder if he's available for PRIVATE functions...?",

My boyfriend got the beef shwarma pita sandwich. MMM I know why iron man wanted shwarma afterwards. It is so flavorful and they give a lot of meat for the sandwich! I love how the acid of the vegetables paired with the thick chunks of meat.\n\nYes, the meat isn't tender and the flavors aren't anything new but it is great comfort food. It also comes with a side dish - rice, French fries, or rice.\n\nSpring for the rice! Its garlicy and fluffy and oh so good!!! The salad is good too but not as filling haha.\n\nI'll be back!",

I was expecting for the pitas to be out fresh out the oven which I thought would have been a perfect compliment to the salsa and hummus.\n\nCon: The Hummus lacked the chickpea texture\n\nSecond Course: I ordered the Kabob combo and my wife ordered the lemon chicken.

                  "review": "Gaby's is a small kitchen connected to a covered outdoor patio that seats about 100 people on a busy night.  Service is decent and the selection of food offers everything Mediterranean that I've ever seen or wanted.  However, I found it odd that our waitress sported a black tank top with the logo of Saints and Sinners, a hipster bar a little further down Venice.  Was it a co-promotion or did this waitress have two jobs on the same street?  I may never know but that's the mystery of it all.\n\nPita is given off the bat along with balsamic vinegar mixed with diced onions and tomatoes.  That's almost a meal unto itself, but of course you'll want try more of what they have to offer.  The soujok, a house-made sausage, is amazing.  They serve it with a spicy stewed tomatoes which reminds me of the way my family cooks Portuguese sausage.  The flavor of the sausage fuses into the tomatoes creating a flavorful sauce that is even better when soaked into your hummus and rice.  \n\nI also ordered the Vegetarian's Choice, a large platter of hummus, rice-only dolmas, falafel, tzatziki and a Mediterranean salad.  I'll probably eat this every time I come here from now on.  Everything tasted fresh and yummy and I didn't even need my usual side of hot sauce (yeah...they don't have a hot sauce nor a chili paste...drat).  When I visit my friends in Culver City you can usually find me at Gaby's.",

I got the rice and my wife got the 1/2 chicken special with Hummus. I can't remember the exact price but believe my special was $8.50 and my wife's special was $7.50 or close to that.\n\nFood came hot and fresh and not slow.\nThis is a good place for lunch, they have valet parking so you don't have to circle the block or park a long ways off now.",

There is no better place to bring a ginormous plastic jug full of green alcoholic liquids than to Gaby's. The food's not so shabby either - their soujok is delish.\n\nActually I lied...kinda.

It's homey, friendly and open late which is super lovely for a neighborhood gal like me who forgot to eat before going to the Irish times on a Sunday night.\n\nI will reiterate what another reviewer said about the pita... we placed an order to-go and I just found it very strange that ordering a side order of baba ghanoush warranted not one pita in our bag.

Don't come here if you expect a fancy burger. Their menu is pretty short and standard. Stick with the classic hamburger&fries combo and you'll be satisfied.  And of course try their pie; the banana cream pie is my favorite because it is SO delicious and flavorful.\n\nSome people are turned off by the U-shaped bar and seat yourself style but hey why not try something different? Everywhere we go we get standard sit-down restaurant. I like finding my own seat and be on it like a hawk. People waiting usually know whose turn is up so no one's ever stolen a seat from me. I will say this though, don't go with a huge group during peak hours because you'll either have to split up or you just won't eat.\n\nOverall, I love this place and the history is has a around it.

Their best burger, the Hickory Burger, has a great smoky taste - but is small and half of it consists of lettuce.  Not sure if the Hickory Burger is worth the drive, traffic of West LA, and tiny parking lot.  I just don't get full off this.  Maybe I need to order two, but for a burger that's $5 each and me being a college student, I'd rather hit up In-N-Out.  \n\nIt's a cool experience going there though.",

Came here on a lunch date with my roomie around noon on a Friday, and we were in and out in half an hour, despite a disconcertingly long lineup on the wall when we first walked in. I take off one star only for the lack of organization with the whole line situation.\n\nRoomie got the hickory burger - juicy, tender, bbq-saucy goodness.  I had the steak burger... it was also delicious, but next time I'd ask them to go easy on the relish.  The flavor can overpower the steak if it's laid on thick.  The burger itself keeps the steak-like texture, which confused my mouth, but the flavor/texture combo of steak, mayo & relish was pretty killer.  Fries were awesome too.  Crispy outside, melty inside...mmmmmm.\n\nAnother service plus, besides the speed and efficiency, was the way the guys behind the counter refilled roomie's drink (even though the can was on the table) and handed us napkins when things started getting messy (even though the napkin dispenser was also on the table)... all this during lunchtime rush & without skipping a beat.  I can't wait to come back to try desserts!",

You have to get all of that to fully enjoy your meal!\n\nSitting gets messy though because it's sooooo BUSY inside. You have to wait behind someone and it's based on the honor system. Usually those standing against the wall are waiting for someone to get up and leave.\n\nI've never seen it NOT busy, even at odd hours, there's always a line somewhere.\n\nParking is horrible too. Small spaces in the back and very limited street parking. It's right across the street from the mall, but I don't recommend parking there either. Gets crowded and why are the spaces sooo small or is it just the bad parkers out there?!\n\nI would come here more often, if it was closer to me!",

I always get the hickory smoked burger, but the regular is great too.\n\nBut whatever you have to do (skip fries, no soda, etc) save room for pie!!!! They are all so good. Do it a la mode (which means \"with mode\"). You can even grab a pie to go or for the holidays.\n\nThis place is very close to 5 Stars, but I hold back because the counter is small and sometimes hard to get a seat and I hate crossing east of the 405 (even though it's only about a mile past).\n\nThe guys behind the counter are a trip! They bark at you like you're an idiot and just when you're about to get pissed off, they do something really nice. One of my favorite places!",

                  "review": "I always tell visitors Apple Pan's one of my top burger joints (other than Father's Office and Umami), but hadn't been in a while.  So glad I went back.  Although you smell like the place hours after your meal and you have to be like hawks to ensure proper seating order (2 separate elderly couples had people waiting in front of them and they totally cut them) - you're gonna be a happy little piggie afterwards (and if you're hungry the service is super fast).  \n\nWe got a hickory burger and steak burger.  It was my first time getting the steak burger and I gotta say EH - I'll stick to the hickory (smokier meat and better flavor combination).  You can taste the burger meat more in the steak burger, but with only a slightly complimenting relish sauce it's barely a step above in-n-out.  \n\nA couple next to us ordered hickory sauce for their fries - so we did the same.  The hickory sauce just tasted like slightly tangier ketchup, but it's good to know it's an option.  I also used to insist on ordering the fries here well done, but no need anymore.  For some reason I liked the exact medium crispiness they came standard.  Since I love the gimmick of the old-school way they serve soda (paper cone in a metal stand) I had to get a rootbeer.  And after all that we still had room for the apple pie a la mode.  They split it for us (without us asking) which was appreciated and convenient.  Apple pan, I'm mad about plaid (wallpaper), and I'm still mad about you.",

                  "review": "2 photos\nApple Pan is one of those place I am often perplexed at. I'm not into the whole institutions or old landmark kind of places. Even though it's been around for awhile, I just get the feeling that people loves the charms of the old place.\n\nThe place actually looked quite nice and very charming as if the outside of the place looked like an old hickory shack. What's even better was that the inside of this place looked very unique as they only have an U-shape counter seats. There are no tables or booth seats for privacy. Just the counter seats like you have seen in the old Alan Ladd film noir days.\n\nI guess they do all their cookings at the brick-layers oven grill as it brings out the flavor I guess. The old mechanical cash register that doesn't need electricity gave the place the old vintage class.\n\nThe menu is very limited at best with only two types of burgers. I skipped the Hickory burger and ordered the steak burger instead. Sounds fancy, but it's just a beef patty burger. I did ordered their two dollar fries. They don't have a combo or very extensive menu. This one page sheet menu pretty much stayed the same forever.\n\nHere's the punch in the gut. That steak burger which sounds fancy, but looked like a famous star from Carl's Junior minus the tomato and such ...cost $8.\n\nYes, I have complained about the gourmet burger coming from a bar that cost $11 in Santa Monica, $12 French toast in West Hollywood, and an $8 omelet in Long Beach. Let's put it this way, if that $8 burger was a wowser, I would not be complaining and comparing it to Carl's.\n\nAlas, it's a decent chow, but not really that good. I'm sticking with In-N-Out Burgers as the better burger in town.\n\nI think I was also held in a stick up when I ordered their Combination. No, that is a combo meal, but just a simple baked ham and Swiss cheese sandwich with a lettuce. Guess how much that was?.......$7.\n\nYes, I can see this place is more geared towards the affluent crowds of people living nearby or people wants to relieve the Golden Age of Eisenhower and Nixon. But geesh, the prices were harsh.\n\nThe place can be crowded with people waiting for a seat. It seats less than 32 people, so you are going to need to be there during non-rush hour. Big groups are discourage from coming here. If you think Daikokuya is bad, you haven't seen this place on a prime lunch or dinner hours.\n\nI'm just too scared to try the pies because I didn't want my wallet to be drained that quick, but apparently some people have no problem stimulating the economy by buying a piece of any of the five different slice of pie that would have cost the same for a whole pie elsewhere.\n\nLike I said, it was really hard for me to understand about this place. Perplexed by the time I walked out and still left unsatisfied.\nSteak Hamburger",

I couldnt imagine how crowded this place could be.\nOtw to another destination, we passed this place, and wonder why its so empty. I mean empty like it was closed. But surprisingly I saw a man walking in. So we changed our mind, and parked nearby. We walked in and find a couple of seats.\n\nI had a steakburger and It was amazing!\nI am always on diet. Everyone knows that. But, this burger is soooo good, that the satisfaction of eating it win over my guilt. Basically, I gulp the whole burger and lots of fries. I even shared a piece of cherry pie with my bf. Cherry pie was awesome. I dont really like cherries, but since they ran out of apple pie so we were kinda desperate.\nTrust me, if u like burger or if u dont (my bf doesnt like anything between breads and he still thinks its GOOD), you should try it!",

The steak burger has a bit of a sweeter sauce while the hickory burger has bbq sauce).\n\nI had the hickory burger and a slice of apple pie. The burger was good and moist with a big stack of crisp iceburg lettuce. The pie was pretty good too (I think it's like a quarter of the pie...).\n\nService is brisk and the burgers come in paper wrapping like at In-n-out (no plates... I recommend efficient napkin usage).\n\nOverall, the food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.",

Expect to wait for a seat if you go during peak eating hours. Then pick a side and wait for that one side which is the protocol over there. My regular waiter Gordon retired this year after 40+ years there. The next newest guy has been there over 20 years!!\n\nThe Hickory Burger is the top recommended dish. Big mound of lettuce and mound of pickles & mayo does not interfere somehow with the delicious hickory flavor sauce, on a fresh beef patty. Grab it with a side of only fairly ok fries and save room for a heavenly hand made slice of pie. Their banana cream is my favorite! It can't be very good for you but man alive it's delicious!!\n\nI recommend going with a friend. It's how typical restaurants looked in the early 1940's. The recipes are all from the same family that has been operating it since it opened. Why change a good thing?\n\nFrankyB",

I have had the hickory burger, the steak burger and the tuna sandwich.  Out of all three, I prefer the tuna sandwich the best because you get a LOT of tuna as opposed to other diners who put maybe a teaspoon of it and pile on the lettuce and tomato.  The portion of tuna was generous.  \n\nThe fries are always delicious.  I have never had a bad meal at the Apple Pan.  \n\nTheir coffee is a lot better than McDonald's and I must admit, their apple pie is terrific as is their chocolate cream pie.  \n\nWhat I DON'T like, and I bow to the majority of the reviewers here is:\n\nParking is awful which is why I walk.  It's a short distance for me.\n\nIt's rather expensive to eat here, I grant you that.\n\nThe staff are long-timers and I don't like their attitude.  I suppose some could consider it part of their charm but I don't.  The men who have taken my order just stand there and wait for me to tell them what I want.  There has never been any dialogue exchanged and while I find that odd, I don't find it rude.  \n\nI don't like that it's a cash only place either but since they have been doing it this way for years, there's not much one can do about it.  Also, these guys have never advertised, it's all word of mouth.  They must be doing something right after over 60 years in the business!\n\nThis is not a place I would take a tourist or an out of towner even though the food is wonderful.  I would not want to subject them to a long wait which is based on the honor system (or it should be) and having a limited menu.  The Apple Pan is a good place to go if you want to eat alone and enjoy having people breathing down your neck waiting for your seat.  \n\nThis is why most of the time I get my order to go so I can enjoy it at home.  Call ahead and your order will be ready when you pick it up.  \n\nOtherwise, save yourself an in-person visit, order your sandwich, fries and pie to go so you can savor it in peace.",

                  "review": "I randomly read a review for The Apple Pan a while back in the LA Times and I thought about how cute it was in it's traditions, etc.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago, my two friends and I found ourselves driving up and down Westwood, starving.  I remembered always seeing The Apple Pan when leaving Westside Pavilion, so we quickly decided to just make a decision and go.  \n\nAfter actually eating here, I think that the restaurant is still in business due to the novelty, more than anything else.  I mean, it has space to seat like, 16 people.  That's why it always looks full.  The menu is one page, and it's all burgers.  The burgers were good, they tasted very good.  But that's about it.  I think it's really sweet, and quaint and all...keeping the small menu, serving everything wrapped in paper, or in paper plates...things like that.  \nI agree with alot of you guys when I say that I DID want to love The Apple Pan, the review in the LA Times made it seem so cute and lovable, but I didn't particularly care for it.  I love the concept of keepin it real, and not changing a good thing, but, it just wasn't as impressive as I thought would be.  \nAfter some thought, I feel like I would SO regular this place if I was living in the area, but that's it.\nHowever, we did have the most ROCKIN-EST server in the world.  He was this older man who -I swear on the love I have for vodka- did not say A SINGLE WORD TO US the entire night.  We would ask for something, and he would just look at us for a second...and then get it.  He was like a character, and had he paid ANY attention to me, I think we would have fallen in love and been set for life.",

The man ordered pie...as an appetizer. Not just any pie...Boysenberry pie. Sighhhh. If I weren't already in love and this man weren't 20 years my senior, we'd be stuffing Boysenberry pie into each other's faces at our wedding. All that aside, I Love this place. It's small, it's cozy, it reminds me of home. The little paper cones they give you to pur your soda in?! Could it be anymore quaint? The burger was awesome (I got the hickory burger) and we shared some yummy fries. I even got a real coke..not diet. Come here and enjoy it for what it is, which is a little burger joint that has survived the LA scene despite it's lack of glitz and presence of non-vegan, no-frills, down home food. Oh, and get the Boysenberry pie. You won't be sorry.",

The Cheddar Hickory burgers are fresh, tasty and greasy!  The french fries are cooked fresh, crisp, nicely salted and tasty.  The counter dudes are efficient and will even dollop-out the catsup on a cardboard plate for you.  Most of the gang working there have worked there over 20-30 years!  It's situated in a u-shaped counter w/ an unobstructed view of the cooking area.\nAll the sandwiches are fresh and the portions are generous.  The apple pie is a religious experience: warm with the glaze oozing onto the plate, rich vanilla ice cream.  Don't forget the percolated coffee with real whipping cream.  If you are faint of heart, just take extra lipator.  Courage in a 5 mg tablet!  Forget about that 6-car parking lot in back.  Its street parking, or parking in the bank parking lot after hours.",

I'm not a big cusser either, but this burger defies the regular burger standard, and thus my description shall defy any moral standards I have. Anywayy, it's cash only, and the seating is limited (bar-style), but it's a small price compared to the heaven you will taste in your mouth. Not only is the flavor filled with authentic tasting bbq sauce and fresh ingredients...but the patty, OH THE PATTY! It's texture is the new black, I mean it's chewy and scrumptious and oh so deliumpcious! TRUST, go there and get the hickory burger, some fries, AND BUTTERMILK! (only the kook farmer kids get how good buttermilk is), oh and their apple pie is mighty fine too =]",

I don't want to pay $10 for a burger that doesn't include fries or a drink.

I got the hickory burger, which had a nice smoky BBQ sauce to top the steak-like patty.  The meat itself was decent, although it wasn't that much different than what you can get at Fatburger.  The fries came out hot and fresh, but they could've used more salt or seasoning.  One of the most nostalgic features of the night was the little funnel-cone shaped cup which I used to drink my Coke.  Overall, it was a very nice setting and meal, and I am happy to cross off another one of my \"must go to\" spots before I graduate.  Thank you Brian Wong for driving me and spotting for my meal!",

My girlfriend & I took 2 of our friends with us for the first time.  When we got there, we were surprised to find that there was about 27 single counter stools \"not a place for groups to socialize!\"  What the hell, if the food is as good as Huell claimed it was, I would overlook it.  When we looked at the menu, a single burger was much more than the price of a burger, fries and drink from In & Out Burger \"by the way the burger at In & Out is 10x better!\"  When we got our burger, it had tons of catsup oozing out.  What made things even worse, the guy serving us the burger spilled 1/2 the bottle of catsup on the plate for us to dip our fries.  The service is great if you like someone pressuring you to eat your meal and get the hell out of Dodge!  When we arrived, we pumped the parking meter for 1-1/2 hours, when we got back to our car 1/2 hour had passed.  Overall the food was way to expensive and not that good.  Having 4 burgers, 2 order of fries, 3 drinks and 2 slices of pie all for $60 \"tip not included\", I'd rather go to In & Out Burger for less and have a better meal.",

Not sure why it still tasted like 100% sweet. I asked for a new drink, they gave me a cup with just tea. So I had to dump out partial of my drink to add and remix my existing drink which brought it to 60% sweet compared to other tea places. Service was ok. There's a very limited menu at this tea shop, but I guess there isn't much competition around so they can just focus on the tea and maybe the local demographic like extra sweet. This did not fancy my taste buds or impress me in any way. Customer service was ok, Would have been better if they cared to adjust the drink accordingly, but instead just tried to get us out of their hair to service the next guest.",

I remembered a friend recommending this new boba spot in Downtown Culver City and knew I had to try it out. This is the old location of the old frozen yogurt spot right on the corner of Main Street. Anyways, parking is always a bit tricky but you can park in the structure old block over and walk.\n\nComing in the employees were really friendly and offered my sister and I various samples of their signature bobas - the roasted brown sugar boba and the honey boba - and gave us the run down of the various teas and the different milk options - soy, 2%, and almond to just name a few. Both were delicious and have their perfect pairings. the roasted brown sugar boba with the milk teas and the honey bobas with the fruit teas. It was hard to choose, but I ended up getting the Assam milk tea, which is a dark black tea, and the most caffeinated milk tea on the menu and my sister got their house favorite, the roasted brown sugar milk tea. She is diabetic, so she got it was less sweet, which was still really good. We also replaced the soy milk with almond milk for a small fee. Our two large drinks ended up being about $16, which is kind of expensive for boba, but it was really good! Would I come back? Most definitely!",

The made in house boba is the perfect amount of softness and chewiness. My family all got the brown sugar milk tea with brown sugar boba as we wanted to try a more classic drink for our first time. We got 75% sweetness, so a little bit less than regular. I believe it may have been to sweet if we got 100% sweetness, but that is a personal preference. The street parking may not be ideal once the area opens up again, but there's a few nearby parking lots.\nRoasted Brown Sugar Milk Tea with brown sugar boba",

Even if they had normal boba, I'd say Latea still ranks in the top 3 of West LA boba.\n\nThe teas are fresh tasting and brewed strong.\n\nLots of comfortable seating, soft lighting... even a little alcove in the back.\n\nHaven't tried the snacks yet, but I'll report back.",

Their brown sugar (homemade old recipe handed down from the owner's grandmother) milk tea & boba were amazing! They also have nitro infused oolong tea which was smooth and full of flavor. I was blown away by their top notch service & their boba was great. Will definitely visiting them again. Soft opening this Friday (12/6) 1-8pm!",

So after hours flying across the country, Kogi seemed like the perfect antidote to airplane hell. We ordered a bunch of tacos, which were decent, especially the tofu. We also got the ooey gooey fries which were a massive, messy carb bomb that didn't really work for me. The canitas should have been crispy and the fries could have been fresher. There was scant evidence of the original genius behing the Kogi concept instead it felt like a franchise in need of a reboot.\nOoey Gooey fries, Shortrib, calimari and tofu.",

For anybody visiting LA, forget In-N-Out and other overhyped places to eat..you can not leave LA without tasting Korean BBQ..I love the fusion they give between the Mexican and Korean to create these options.\n\nI went with the pacman burger, my fiance went with the kimchi quesadilla..SOOO FREAKING YUMMY DELICIOSO ORGASMIC...not sure if I can say that but yeah pretty much accurate.\n\nI saw that it wasn't rated highly and I can't believe people have knocked it down and rated it 1 star because of the size of the space. Sure it's a tiny place they're starting their brick n mortar for now but I can picture this growing and knocking down walls and they will look like fools for rating this place 1 star due to \"space\"...the food is still freaking 5 stars!\n\nThey don't appreciate that instead of chasing a late night food truck all over LA, we finally got a good location to enjoy...advice: head there on weekdays before 7 pm and you won't have much trouble finding a seat and eating in peace.\nPacman burger combo with spicy rib taco and I love the crushed ice...100 stars if it allowed me to rate it that high!",

This review is based on the employees that were working on March 20th at 6 pm. I came in and brought family and friends who have never been to kogi before. After we order, we receive the complete incorrect order. When telling the young man he directed me to the lady at the cashier. Who told me I did not order that and would refuse to correct our order. I even said we don't care about the money we will pay again for the correct food items as my cousin could not eat meat and needed tofu. She was so rude, would ignore us, and treated us disrespectfully. I was embarrassed to have brought my friends and family here. Will stick to food truck locations only.\nextremely rude employee",

                  "review": "I've had Kogi for so many times but never left a review until now! I love the Korean Mexican flavors. My go-tos are the short rib taco and the two quesadillas. The short rib taco is so rich in the Korean marinated sauce flavor and sesame oil aroma. Paired with the cabbage pieces in a light spicy dressing, the entire taco has so many flavors all at one time.\nI really like the kimchi quesadilla because it combines the traditional Korean kimchi with generous amounts of cheese and a spicy sauce! You get a tad of the kimchi tangy-ness but you also get the typical gooey cheese in a quesadilla. The flour tortilla is also quite thin so its not too heavy. The blackjack quesdilla is also really delicious because of the meat they put inside. While it lacks the powerful flavor of the kimchi, it does have the Korean marinated meat flavors as well as the jalapeno and sesame fusion (green) sauce.\nRecently, I was also able to try the spicy pork taco. Although the meat might look like the short rib if you take a quick glance, the two meats taste different with different sauces. I like how the spiciness comes from the pork meat vs. the spiciness in the short rib taco came from the added sauce. The carne asada taco had your standard Mexican flavors but not so much the fusion Korean taste.\nWhenever I have friends or family visiting LA, I always bring them to Kogi (store or food truck) because it really highlights the vibrant mixture of cultures/cuisines in this city!\nAt the store, there is plenty of seating but when its busy, you might have to wait. There is a mini parking lot in front of the store/in the next alley way but it can also be pretty packed during rush hour.",

I came with a group of friends a few nights ago, and the girl at the counter (latina, curly hair) was so rude.  Idk if she thought I didn't understand spanish (or she just didn't care) but she went off (loudly and laughing) about their \"tip\" (even though all she's doing is taking my order; there are no waiters or anything.)  \nI kid you not, the entire time I was there, she and the other two cooks were staring at me all serious, or she would be laughing hysterically snickering, and talking to her co-workers while looking at me.  So I felt super uncomfortable the entire time and honestly didn't even feel like eating the food since they looked like the type who would do something to it.  \nPlease hire polite staff, or teach this girl some proper etiquette, otherwise it makes your customers not want to come back.

The meat was juicy and it was piled with vege's on top. Their sauce is wonderful. This is also a very light item to get if you are trying to not leave stuffed. We also got the Kogi hot wings. These are huge wings!  The seasoning is really good. It is not 'goopy' but instead a little dry - but not in a bad way. It is wonderful and thick and sticks to the wing. And oh so tasty.\n\nMy boyfriend got the sweet chili chicken quesadilla. This is what he gets every time - I can't convince him to get something different. Need I say more?!\n\nWe also got an item off of the chef specials list. It was the Kimchi Carnitas ooey gooey fries. I don't know what all is on these fries but you need to get them!  We got the mini size and it was plenty big enough to share!  They did not overdo the kimchi which was great as I am not a huge fan of all the garlic in it.\n\nNeedless to say we ordered way too much food for the two of us and took home quite a bit. Great deal for $24!",

It is real good a bunch of meats, cheese, mayo and cabbage real delicious. I am definitely returning to try their kogi hot dog also another popular item in their menu.

Between us all, we had the short rib tacos (which totally live up to the hype), carnitas, calamari tacos, carne asada tacos and chicken burrito, as well as the chocolate tres leche cake.   Everything delicious.  Great fast casual place.  GET THE SHORT RIB TACOS!!",

The quality has really gone down hill since this location opened. The food is bland and greasy, the meat is chewy. It seems like they no longer care about making quality food here. The food at the trucks and the Alibi Room is still just as good as ever so I know it's not an overall issue with Kogi - just this spot. Get your Kogi elsewhere!",

Love the small scale, family run, attention to detail, fresh and delicious food, esp the crispy rice dishes. Brown rice is far more flavorful than white so it can overwhelm a sushi dish or roll, but here the balance is made with spicy tuna, spicy salmon etc (more delicate flavors are reserved for non rice dishes like sashimi or carpaccio). I though the prices were very reasonable for such fresh food and a creative menu (2 of us for dinner for $40), and the texture of the rice was perfect.

It literally can only seat 4 people inside.\n\nI'm really picky about my sushi, and maybe this place was built up too much by everyone who I went with, but it's just not my cup of tea.  It's really cute and I love that it's a tiny mom and pop joint, but I just can't do brown rice sushi.  Yes, it IS softer than you would expect brown rice sushi to be, and don't get me wrong, I'm a huge brown rice enthusiast.  But sushi rice is just meant to be rice vinegary flavored and melt in your mouth, and that's not what this sushi is like.\n\nI never tried the sashimi because I got the lunch special with ca roll, so unfortunately I couldn't judge how fresh the sashimi was either.  However, their truffle salt edamame was great.\n\nThere's neighborhood parking in the side streets, but my friends and I walked from their place so we didn't have any trouble.  Personally, I wouldn't come back again, but again I have a biased opinion.",

They are all SUPER FREAKING DELICIOUS, I was especially impressed by their sashimi salad, 5 big slices of super fresh melt-in-your-mouth quality fish on top of greens with a nice sesame soy dressing, will definitely order that everytime.\n\nSo when you count the fact that their entire menu is nothing but rolls, crispy rice sushi, and the items I have listed above, we reach one conclusion: everything on their damn menu tastes great.\n\nbtw their new business hours are:\nMon-Sat 12pm~3pm\nMon-Sat 5pm~9pm\nSunday Close.  \n\nMust be because of the groupon effect.",

The brown rice brings out all the right flavors and it is like your first time trying sushi all over again. They challenge you to compare their miso with \"the other guys\" and it is hands down the best miso I've ever had. Do yourself a grand favor and get the albacore/ truffle roll. It was so good we had to order two more- literally a party in your mouth. Please also try their crispy rice with spicy tuna, if you know whats good for ya. Heck! Even the salad was good! They have the soy sauce in a little spritzer which is kitschy and adorable. The staff was nice and you can bring your own booze.",

Crispy fried brown rice + any of their spicy fish is amazing. It's like a party in mouth and only the hot people are invited. I'm sure the frying defeats the healthy parts of brown rice sushi, but man.\n\nTheir nigiri was pretty good, too. Ordered a toro, which was nice and fresh. Brown rice certainly lends a nuttiness that I find different. Can't say I prefer it over regular sushi, but it's nice to have something different every once in a while.\n\nBut yeah, crispy rice.

Stopped in on my lunch break and was in and out very quickly so I liked that too. I LOVE that they use brown rice, the only time I can find that is when I buy sushi from Whole Foods. The truffle salt albacore was decadent (although it was hard not to put soy sauce on it like she recommended) and the spicy tuna roll was unlike any I've ever tasted, in a good way! I loved the dressing on the green salad, housemade dressings can be hit or miss but this definitely hits it. I look forward to coming here again to try more raw fish. Check it out if you are in the neighborhood!",

I became a little reluctant to eat there since no one was there at the time.  Looked at the menu and it has brown rice sushi which I have never had before.  \n\nAnyway, I gave it a shot and I was pleased with the sushi even though I was not too excited about the brown rice.\n\nI will be coming back because the sushi I ordered was pretty good and I guess I will just have to get used the brown rice.  Anyway brown rice is healthier than the white rice.\n\nMy wife tried the fried brown rice sushi.  It was good but I need to stay away from fried food for health reasons.\n\nI had the Nigiri Sushi (they had another name) and it was great.  The miso soup and edamame was great also.\n\nAfter we sat down to eat a lot more people came also. I recommend this restaurant.",

The lack of space in the restaurant and the wait time are insignificant here. The food is that good. Love the brown rice sushi - I personally prefer the flavor of brown rice to white rice, but for all practical purposes it a very small change that I don't think anyone will even notice. It looks like there's already strong hype around the crispy brown rice sushi, but YOU MUST BELIEVE EVERY WORD!! We ordered the spicy roasted salmon and the spicy tuna, in crispy form. So yeah..hot, crispy bed of brown rice with fresh, tasty fish and tiny sliced cucumber on top?! YES PLEASE.\n\nWe also ordered miso soup, the California roll, and the organic chicken teriyaki roll off the specials menu. Everything was fresh and absolutely delicious. Since my friend doesn't prefer (aka is terrified of) slabs of raw fish, I didn't get to try the sashimi or nigiri, though I can't imagine that it's anything but incredible, since everything we ate was.\n\nNo alcohol served, but you can bring your own if you so desire.\n\nThomas and Sophia really do a wonderful job here. I completely understand the need for their 4-5 closing. Neither of them stopped moving the entire time we were there. I definitely plan to come back here when I'm in LA and support this little place because it's truly something special. Shikibu has only been open since November, and seems to be doing really well for only two employees and the relatively random location. Throughout our meal we watched a steady stream of regulars come to pick up food...I just wish I lived closer so I could be one of them!",

Venturing out into the world of sushi, trying new things raw and weird looking (note: I'm from the Midwest, anything not steak and potatoes qualified as \"weird\" at age 19). She would be shocked and perhaps a bit proud. It's happened in baby steps...from ordering vegetable tempura and miso soup whenever my friends in college would go for sushi...to cucumber avocado rolls...to California rolls...and now finally within the last year California has officially permeated my entire being and I'm down for trying all things sushi. This is a fabulous thing, especially in coming to Shikibu.\n\nYou see Shikibu does your \"regular\" sushi--rolls, nigiri, etc., but they also have some very interesting and delicious specialties that one must try. First, crispy rice. It's like a potato pancake (midwesterner likey!), but it's brown rice, not potatoes, with a fish of your choosing beautifully lain atop it. We chose Yellow Tail--and it was perfect. Then, there's the \"BSC\"--Baked scallop on California. It was as advertised! The real crab meat made it even better. Finally, I had to go with a fail safe/baseline and I chose a spicy tuna roll. It was deliciously wonderful in every way.  I will be going back and probably ordering exactly the same things!\n\nNow, as per everyone, it's small. There are 8 seats, plus 2 outside. I'm not really sure what to say about that. We went on a Tuesday night around 7pm and there were 2 open seats available. I would definitely wait in a 30 minute line though! Their lunch specials look awesome and completely reasonable as well.\n\nThe staff and chef were personable and I loved the \"Dos and Don'ts\" of sushi eating posted on the wall. I have definitely been in violation of rubbing my chopsticks together, and placing my hand under my chin to catch rogue food. They also advertise their vegetable cakes--for example spinach and strawberry cake. I am incredibly intrigued by this and am going to make a point to try one and update once I do!",

SO glad we did!\n\nI started with a mini green salad and he got the seaweed salad. Both come with a house made carrot and ginger dressing. So yummy and fresh tasting. A perfect mix of tart and sweet. We then got the yellowtail &jalapeno. Again, very fresh and good kick with the jalape\u00f1o. Then came the truffle salt and albacore roll. So simple and delicious. We finished with the spicy tuna on crispy rice, which, despite being fried, tasted so clean.\n\nThis place is great. They use brown rice in everything, and try to (very politely) educate their customers not only on sushi etiquette but also how your eating affects your body and health! We will definitely be back soon, and hope to try their house made green tea ice cream  next time!",

This spot is tiny (only 6 seats) but has some of the best tasting sushi in all of the city (suck it Sugarfish). Chef uses brown rice which adds a nuttiness to the flavors. It might be a problem for all the \"authentic sushi snobs\" out there, but don't let it dissuade you. What Chef Thomas is doing here is amazing. The sushi is fresh and the flavors are unique. He also has a deep love for Star Wars (half the specialty rolls are references to the films) which I appreciate. Make sure if you go you order the Darth Vader roll.",

I might have to say it's some of the freshest sushi I've tasted in a while, and especially to come from a hole in the wall - I am impressed.\n\nSince it's all brown rice sushi, it's on the expensive side, but I would definitely come here again. I've been craving their salmon roll ever since I went there!",

It doesn't hurt that it's better for you too!\n\nThe Red Phoenix roll is my favorite roll so far.  The spicy tuna gives it just the right amount of heat and the avocado finishes it off with a nice balance.  The Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna on top was a great appetizer to get.  I had never seen this at other sushi places, so it was a nice to try something new!\n\nThe service can be slow, but it is worth the wait.  It's nice to not have to be in such a rush when out to eat anyways.  The owners are very friendly.  The place is very small, counter inside seats 6 at most.  There are a couple tables outside as well.  \n\nThis is definitely my new go-to sushi spot!",

Delicious & healthy can be used in the same sentence when describing the food here. Only thing that detracts is the lack of parking, as it is street only. Also, like others have stated, it's best for a one on one dinner or solo, no groups. I came here again, on my own this time and found out they are closed 12/16-1/5 for renovations. So sad. :( (I just posted this draft belated and realized my tip on the renovation is no longer relevant! LoL)",

This eating spot sits a total of 10 people--enough for 6 at the bar inside and spots for 4 more outside.  Definitely don't come here expecting to sit with a party of twelve (but do order take away). The place is run by a husband and wife team who are appreciative and friendly.  The food is fresh and quickly prepared.  The prices are reasonable.  \n\nEven though I was a skeptical of brown rice sushi (no thanks to Whole Foods supposed sushi bar), I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by the brown rice sushi. The rice is perfectly cooked--soft, but not undercooked--and crisped lightly, and not oily as I've had at other places serving crispy rice.  I've tasted several of the crispy brown rice sushi options, but my favorite is the Crispy Rice w/Spicy Roasted Salmon which is coincidentally, served as part of an $8 Lunch special accompanied by a healthy portion of seaweed salad and miso soup.  \n\nEach time I've eaten at Shikibu, I've left looking forward to returning and trying something new on their menu (their non-crispy sushi is also very good and fresh). But I will always make sure to order a crispy brown rice item--they're just too good to pass up.",

Truffle salt albacore & truffle salt edamame for a unique take on a classic order. The salads are great for the homemade dressing that is beyond incredible. Even the miso soup is amazing! I could keep going, but it's better if you just make it a point to try Shikibu.\n\nFresh fish, fast service, and BYOB - A rarity for sushi in LA!

The over all fish quality was good.. only the salmon was weird to me... maybe it was just the temp but is was way too warm for me.. sushi has to be cold. The rest of the fish were good and I tried them all. I really didn't like the whole soy spray bottle.. got annoying after one piece. I'd rather dip.. the spray kinda goes everywhere and it takes too much work. The place is tiny and super quiet so it uncomfortable to have a conversation. My over all feeling is it would be better if you can get one of the two tables outside... or just get take out.. also no sake.. but you can byob.",

I guess if all you do is order a roll then the price is fine.  \n\nOne of my friends ordered the BSC (baked scallop on california) roll and it had mixed reactions of tasting either like \"plastic\" or almost entirely of \"sesame seeds\" from the two of them.  The rainbow roll also got unfavorable responses from them as they thought the fish was not very fresh.\n\nI feel like people are just getting swayed by brown rice and organic (as in the vegetables) ingredients.",

It's like 1/4 of a sushi bar.  This place observes certain traditional Japanese customs, so be aware of this (e.g. not rubbing your chopsticks together because it implies that the ones given to you are cheap).  The food, however, is quite good and the chef and the lone waitress were both nice. The prices were fair; not cheap, but not expensive considering that the fish was a step above what you would get at Sushi Mac.  The fried rice dishes were excellent and all of the fish tasted fresh and delicious.  Parking is on the street and you can take orders to go.

All the rolls were 'inside-out' (rice outside) and accented with toasted sesame seeds.  Service was excellent.  The waitress was was a sweetheart.  She was really tiny, too.

Him: with a name like that, they've gotta serve sushi. *turned the corner and parked*. I checked Yelp and saw positive reviews and 10% off if you mentioned it :)\n\nTiny interior (6 seats at a counter make for an intimate setting - another patron came in and it was practically a menage-e-trois, but nice nonetheless - and if you're reading this, hi Sarah!). Brown rice sushi? I was hesitant at first, but I'm totally a fan! Bonus - they serve a nice salad with yumsky dressing and miso soup before you get your food! We had the BSC (baked scallop over CA roll), Red Phoenix roll (spicy tuna with avocado on top), rainbow roll & dragon roll (eel with avocado on top). I thought everything was DELISH! FFP said it was \"aight\". We both agree fish & veggies were F-R-E-S-H! Gotta try the crispy rice sushi next time. Didn't read enough of the reviews to heed the suggestions. 2-person staff was attentive and cute, feels like you're eating in their home. Take into consideration the fact that I was SUPER hungry and had an audible sushi craving, and that we had just gotten back from Vegas the night before and his system (tummy especially) was still recovering... and you have a balanced review!",

Delicious food.\n\nHighly recommend the Ultimate Tiger Roll (seared salmon on top, raw salmon and avocado inside, hint of lemon flavor). Asparagus with tamarind sauce was delightfully crunchy. Edamame with truffle salt was a little overpowering but still yummy.\n\nLimited seating, but if you like an intimate atmosphere, this is the place for you. The spray soy sauce got some getting used to, but it encourages you to use it sparingly, which is healthier.\n\nGreat local gem. Can't wait to go back.",

(And more filling) They use real crab meat! Bake crab handroll is where it's at! Creamy mayo-ey crab goodness! If I'm hungry, id go for a crab handroll+ yellowtail roll which is like roughly 20 bucks. (I dont think their lunch specials really fill you up but I eat alot :/ )\n\nPlace is TINY (sits maybe 5 people inside, counter style) and 2 tables outside but the mom and pop charm is super cute! Glad this place is so close to work.",

I love their homemade salad dressing of carrots and ginger and only wish I could get a larger salad with a topping of salmon sashimi as a lunch or dinner dish.  I absolutely love the crispy rice sushi and think this is their signature dish.  I did not care much for the pokey but that is the only thing so far that I didn't love to eat.

(literally it has 5 stools up against a counter. I recommend take out).\n\nSupposedly what sets this place apart is the fact that they only use brown rice, not the traditional sticky rice that most other places use.  Don't be upset by this; it really does taste the same, and if you've tried the brown rice sushi from whole foods, this is pretty much the same deal.  They also said their crispy rice sushi was a  specialty, and very popular, but unfortunately I didn't order it.  Definitely next time.\n\nI ordered 3 rolls to go, and was impressed by how quickly they made my food.  I was in and out in probably about 10 mins...granted I was the only person there at 3:30 in the afternoon.  sushi was good; very fresh.  6 pieces per roll. can't complain.  My favorite was the t-rex roll made with cucumber, cream cheese, and topped with tuna.  yum.\n\nA good place to check out if you're in the area.",

There's six counter spaces, you'll be facing the open kitchen and chef, and then about 4 spaces outside. Simple rolls (maki style only, no nigiri sushi) and salads, with a health conscious twist. Their specialty is brown rice sushi, and it does add a certain nuttiness to the rolls. I'm slightly obsessed with their wakame salad - and actually come to think of it, next time, I'm ordering TWO and don't pass the crispy rice tuna sushi. I'm looking forward to their cakes, too! Very friendly service. Their take out takes about 20-30 minutes. Parking is wherever you can find it, but beware of the tow away signs!",

I love the brown rice and the very traditional approach to making sushi.  The tuna poke salad was a perfect light dinner one night.  The freshness of the fish and the vibrancy of the flavors lures me back.  Even the miso soup tastes amazing.  I have heard that Thomas has been a chef in some famous restaurants.  Thank you for opening Shikibu.  Your talent is definitely appreciated.  A tip: be patient; your meal is not just prepared, but crafted.",

Everything was delicious - the fish was fresh, the dishes each had a unique take on traditional sushi. But what made the experience memorable was having a conversation with the chef after the meal. Turns out this guy used to work with the iron chef himself, chef morimoto! After hearing that I began thinking back on the meal and realizing just how impeccable his skills were. From the slicing of the fish, to the perfect sear and touch of lemon on the tiger salmon roll everything was perfect. This little place is a gem. An amazing find and I feel lucky to have found it... When you go make sure to speak with Thomas (the chefs american name). You'll be glad you did - he has a great food philosophy and is a dedicated craftsmen. BTW he uses only brown rice with his sushi because it's healthier and has a natural sweetness (his words) and he was right - he soaks the rice for 8 hours before cooking and it's amazing.",

With all considerations I would rather have my sushi with white rice. It just seems to taste far superior to the brown rice. We had tried the albacore and jalopeno sashimi special, which in IMO was a little too tart with the ponzu sauce( maybe it could have done with less). And it was kind of pricey for 4 pieces($13).  Also had the tuna and crispy onion sashimi, but the presentation and taste was dissapointing but the tuna in both dishes was fresh and soft (on a good note). Craving the tuna crispy rice but this wasn't as good as I remembered.  That one was ordered as a lunch special , had a seaweed salad(yummm) and the miso soup which was really good. My highlight of lunch was the B.I.G. roll. that was really good and like always rainbow roll . Lunch came out to $66 without tax and its seems kind of high to me.  I will always have this placce in my mind if I have a craving. Its close to me but i do prefer another place on Sawtell(Hide sushi). Oh...the service was really good i must mention but I prefer my green tea in leaves not bagged.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n12/21/2011Previous review",

The chicken was seasoned beautifully & had so much flavor with all of the added toppings. Drizzle some of the red sauce on top & you're destined for happiness.\n\n- Mushroom taco w/ flour tortilla (10/10): I'm not even vegetarian (clearly) & this was bomb. I don't even know what sauce they simmer the mushroom in but it's liquid gold i tell you.\n\nYou've been warned that you'll prob be back for round 2!\nChicken & Mushroom taco (drool)",

They have a parking structure, but I opted to park on a side street, since I was only picking up my online order.\n\nI ordered the chicken taco and mushrooms on the side. Compared to other dining places in the area and inflation of the dollar, this place is a financially viable option with a decently large sized taco. The mushrooms were also a great side that helped fill the extra percentage of stomach space I had left. And the food here tastes great with quality ingredients. I especially enjoyed the clean tasting mushrooms.",

There's not much else. Although the list is short, the quality of standards are not.\n\nI went with the asada plate yesterday and it was absolutely excellent. I don't really see the point in ordering tacos here because the portion size is so large and allows you to make 3-4 tacos with the tortillas they give you. I'm not really a bowl kind of guy, so this was a pretty efficient method, and I was still able to eat the dregs on the side.\n\nLocation-wise, it's in a bit of an awkward spot. It's a great spot to run out really quick for take-out, but difficult to find without a lot of parking surrounding the area.\n\nOverall, I was beyond satisfied with my first Loqui experience. It's one of the better Mexican plate deals around, where for just under $14 you get high quality food that tastes amazing, and plenty of it. Wish there was more of these around the LA area, but when in Culver City or DTLA, definitely check it out.\nBeef plate",

Tonight I was craving some tacos so I decided to try out Loqui. Loqui is in a bit of a nicer spot as it's located in the Platform, but the shop itself is your typical to-go spot - order at the counter. I placed my order online through Toast and I swear it was ready within minutes so I don't think you'd have to wait that long if you ordered in person.\n\nI got two primos (tacos?) - I honestly don't know what a primo is haha but I guess it's pretty much a taco? I got the chicken and pork on flour. Typically I'm a corn tortilla fan but I have to say the flour didn't disappoint - especially given the amount of oil/grease rolling off of the meat, the flour tortilla is a nice balance, but I would be willing to try the corn next time. Honestly given the price point ($6) I wasn't disappointed by the tacos - super flavorful and unique. I preferred the pork between the two, but both were bomb. Two tacos was plenty for me, so it's a fair portion and not too overpriced imo.\n\nParking - I refuse to park in the Platform parking structure, so I recommend you try finding parking in the neighborhood - it's not that hard! Def beats having to pay $2 just to pick some food up. If you do choose to eat here, saving some money is still worth it!\n\nOverall, nice spot to pick up food to go or even to eat at the platform and have some dessert options afterwards.

It wasn't very busy and there is both indoor and outdoor seating (apx 3 tables outside). We got one beef taco, one pork taco and chips and guacamole. Their tacos are on the pricier side (~$6) and are larger than traditional street tacos. I was pretty filled by my taco but my partner ate his in about 3 bites. The meat inside the tacos were both very tender. The chips and guacamole were excellent. The chips tasted fresh and it also came with some salsa on the side, which we also enjoyed.\n\nWe parked across the street at the platform parking , $2 for the first hour.

They seem simple, but are so flavorful and fresh. Mushroom is a little bit spicy too so caution if you're more sensitive to heat. They're decently sized tacos - bigger than street tacos with more items on them. I'd say 1 is great for a snack, and 2 or 3 for a meal.

Even if the time lapsed was 12 hrs...it's such a happy experience I look around to see if anybody else feels the same way at the first bite. I always opt for the flour tortilla. This tortilla rocks. So not sure how the corn tortilla effect is, but I've become loyal to their flour. They have a secret. The beef bowl w corn tortillas comes w rice beans guacamole is also a deconstructed happy excursion. Loqui has me.

We arrived recently on a Sunday around 4pm, my order was ready quickly in about 7 minutes or so.  I ordered the chicken taco and the mushroom taco.  I got it with everything which includes: cheese, guacamole, onion, cilantro, and salsa.  The salsa did had a kick but then again I don't normally eat anything spicy.  I love tacos (who doesn't?) but I prefer flour tortillas more than anything.  Here at Loqui they make it their flour tortillas fresh! It's warm, soft and so  delicious! I was singing the MMMMMmmmmmm song the whole time I was eating this taco.  \n\nWe don't normally venture out to Culver City so we actually didn't know where to park for this plaza. My husband had to park at a waiting zone while I ordered our snack tacos.  But since there's a location in DTLA much closer to us we can't wait to try it there! These tacos are bit pricey at $6 each, but hey you gotta treat yourself once in a while.\nChicken taco and Mushroom taco",

I ordered off DoorDash after scrolling through my options from the Culver City location, which has rave reviews on Yelp. I've now tried both the chicken plate and the mushroom plate - as well as their chips and salsa. The food came quickly and still warm when dropped off (non-contact) at my door. I was pleasantly surprised by how much food there was on each plate - it's definitely a hearty meal! All the ingredients tasted super fresh and not that salty, which I'm always afraid of when I order take out. But this was so good, that I knew I needed to have it again! The chips had the perfect crunch and tasted freshly made and the salsa had just the right amount of kick! The homemade tortillas (both the flour and the corn) are lightweight yet durable and hold together.\n\nLoqui is perfect for a filling, healthy lunch or dinner. I will be ordering again very soon!!\nChicken plate (left) & mushroom plate (right) w corn tortillas\nMushroom plate + Chips & Salsa",

I suggested we have lunch first at an Irish pub called Auld Fella for a Club Sandwich. She countered with a Mexican restaurant called Loqui. She never heard of my suggestion and I never heard of hers. You obviously know who won out!\nLoqui was this super clean (in every respect) taqueria / bowl restaurant that was making some very interesting and eclectic food. My wife ordered one  chicken taco and one mushroom taco; she just devoured them with an interesting grin on her face. Of course I asked her for a bite, and I too was grinning. Let's just call Loqui's tacos, happy food.\nI had a pork plate (they call it that, but it was really a bowl). It was shredded pork with rice, guacamole, beans, pickled onions, lettuce and a red and green hot sauce. It was excellent.\nLet me circle back to \"the super clean\" part; my pork bowl was not salty, or greasy or fatty or unattractive. It was pretty food.\n\nSo, to sum up this review:\nWe had one happy lunch and one pretty lunch on the same day, in the same restaurant, at the same table - thank you Loqui for this rather unique experience!",

The chips are crispy and their guacamole is not overly salty like most places. Their chips, guacamole, and their tortillas is my favorite thing to order. Their tacos are kinda pricy they are $6 each but the tacos are pretty large I usually just order one of them.\nIn my opinion, I don't really like the sauce that they use on the tacos its kind of spicy but thats just me lol have a low tolerance for spicy foods. but the tacos are flavorful I like to order their pork taco, beef taco and mushroom taco. I like the pork and mushroom taco the best I like the seasoning on it. I would skip the cheese quesadilla cause they don't really add anything to do it I think its just mozzarella cheese.\n\nNote: It's a really nice area there's a few other restaurants and stores around the restaurant to walk around. Parking may be hard to find. they do not have street parking on their street.\nIt can get busy on the weekdays during lunch time so I usually like to call the order in.

I didn't help pick up the order, but apparently the parking lot didn't charge for parking and allowed cars to pull in and pick up food.\n\nI ordered the mushroom plate since it's the only vegetarian option available right now (not sure if they normally have more options). I had the option to choose between flour or corn tortillas so I chose flour. They came packaged separately from my bowl, which gave me the ability to customize my tacos. The flour tortillas were slightly translucent and a different style than I've seen before, but delicious nonetheless. The bowl itself was very flavorful and extremely filling! I ate about 2/3 of it and saved the rest for later, so for $11 it was a really great deal.\n\nWe also ordered a side of chips with salsa and guacamole, which was delicious.\n\nI can't wait to order from Loqui again soon!\nMushroom Plate with Flour Tortillas ($11)",

First thing first staff WASNT the most friendly but I don't even really care about that (I left a great tip even tho it is order at the register). Anyway my chicken taco tasted nice but it was so unbearably spicy my eyes were watering and the rest of the meal my tongue was basically numb. I'm not afraid of some spice. This was unbearable to the point it was making me cough. The only thing that helped was getting ice cream two doors down. I'm serious! The other thing I wasn't down for was cold chips. But that's a preference thing. Definitely not worth the drive or the nearly 50$ I spent. Similar to chipotle.? The one thing that tasted amazing was the red meat. But I prefer chicken id not ever order red meat as my meal . Anyway kinda bummed! But oh well . Tour de yelp",

Very flavorful!\n\nI'm a girl on a budget, and it was just a tad more than I wanted to pay, a little over 11.00 for both, but doable.\n\nI really felt I had a true quality taco. Love love love!!! Sooo delish!  Wowsie!!! Seriously!\n\nI'll be back.\nOh, p.s. I tried to get through to make sure they were open, but I didn't  see a contact number.

It is in a weird corner next to Kreation. The food is great, simple and delicious. It kind of reminds me of an expensive and better quality version of Chipotle. There wasn't many options but I didn't mind it as I always get their burrito bowl. My son loves their cheese quesadilla. Flour tortilla was buttery with tangy cheese in between. It does not get as crowded as Wurstk\u00fcche so I prefer to come here! Price is a little on the pricey side.",

I had no idea about their flour tacos so when the waiter told me that's what their known for I switched my order from corn to flour. Best decision ever! Only thing I wish they had was a sauce bar. If you need anything you have to ask for it. You don't get that greasy feeling that you get from street tacos here, which is exactly what I wanted. I felt great after the meal and it felt very healthy. So healthy that you can have some room for boba next door at boba guys:)\n\n+chicken taco: 7/10- kind of bland and dry for my taste, but luckily there is sauce to mask it. Wish they added some Pico de Gallo\n-mushroom taco: 10/10-extremely tasty and will always be ordering this!\nChicken Taco on Flour",

The only problem is that they don't have any signage on the outside of the patio so we had to end up walking around the entire building to find the place.\n\nNow onto the food. We got the chicken plate and every type of taco. The chicken plate was perfect for the little guy. He liked it so much he even clapped after his first bite.\n\nThe tacos were equally amazing. The pork ones has a bit more of a kick BUT well worth it. Halfway through the meal my wife said that the only way they'd get less than 5 stars is if they coughed in our face, and even then it would still be a 3. Yeah, we'll be back.",

Small menu -  which I welcome because it makes decisions easier. The carne asada taco with flour tortilla gets 4+ stars all the way (which is what saves this review from being 2 stars). However, everything else was sub par. We ordered the molcajete bowls and only got tacos. We didn't quite even know what a molcajete was, so we went with it - but still, kind of annoying they got our order wrong. The chicken taco was pretty good also. The mushroom taco and al pastor (pork) not so great. The chips/guacamole was the biggest disappointment - one star status there...tasted like un unripe avocado)s), no flavor and severely under salted. Would definitely go back for the beef/flour combo, but wouldn't waste my time or taste buds with anything else on the menu.",

I also appreciated that it didn't taste too greasy or heavy while maintaining so much flavor. Pretty much every bite had a slight bit of spice to it - nothing overwhelming, just enough. They also serve beer which is a great bonus. The indoor seating is relatively limited and can be a little noisy although it is cute and in line with the ambiance of the surrounding area. I enjoyed taking my bowl outside and hanging out in the hip little alley (Loqui is located in the Platform complex). Service was really quick despite a bit of a line when we first arrived, although it would probably be good to avoid the peak of the lunch rush.",

Barely even spoke to us. If you're going to sell $5 mediocre tacos, you can at least be friendly. The tacos really aren't that great, but I will say I did enjoy the melted cheese in them. The chicken was tasteful too, but sadly that (lack of) service just made this place seem like over-hyped crap.",

It's located in a really great spot in Downtown Culver City and it's got a great ambiance and feel to it. It's chill enough to feel relaxed and casual but it's also pretty trendy!\n\nThere's a lot of space here. There's a front patio, an indoor area with a full bar, an upstairs area that is very loung-y (and also has a bar) and an upstairs outdoor patio. With all that said, there's plenty of places to sit and I would imagine it's hard for it to feel super busy here. I came here for lunch and got a bison burger which was SO good. I love bison burgers and that one really hit the spot. We also got some of the truffle oil fries to share and they were quite delicious. When I came here for a work happy hour, I shared the hummus and pita with a friend and then I ordered the ahi tacos off the appetizer menu for my meal. Both were very good and I loved the warm pita! The tacos weren't your typical Mexican style tacos, but more Asian. They were made with crispy won tons for the shells and stuffed with spicy ahi and served with guac/sour cream. It was really tasty and I'd definitely order all of them again.\n\nThe service was a little off, to be honest. The servers seemed a little weird and annoyed. I know everyone has bad days, so I won't hold it against them. But each time food was brought out, the person who brought it didn't say anything and just held the food there waiting for us to move the menu (I assume). Not sure why they couldn't just set the food on top of the menu, but okay.\n\nThere's no parking lot for this restaurant, or any of the others on this street for that matter. You'll either have to get street parking, valet, or park in the garage across the street. I always park in the garage because it's the most convenient, especially at busy hours, and it's fairly cheap. Be warned though, Rush does not validate parking from the garage.\nSpicy ahi tacos.",

It's a good size for LA. The dance area has couches and little ottomans you can sit on with these glowing tables for light. There is a minimum of $80 in charges to have a table - good deal for 2 or 4 people. $80 Also an $8 per person cover per person.\n\nWe had a cheese pizza ($8) (not on the menu, but they had no problem with accommodating our order) and the hummus plate ($13). I wasn't crazy about the hummus plate - there was a lot of yummy hummus but only like 3 little slivers of bread would have preferred pita chips, but the pizza was great.\n\nThere were 5 of us. All our drinks were good. I think our bill only came to $180 bucks and we drank all night!  Jack and Cokes ($10/ea), Stoli Vodka ($9 each) Bombay ($13 each)\n\nThere is an outside patio in the back upstairs that is pretty cool. They allow smoking out there in case you are so inclined. There is ONE unisex bathroom upstairs, but the bathroom downstairs had no line and so that is the call.\n\nThere was a DJ. DJ Pickel, yelp.com/biz/dj-pickel-l\u2026, he played a great mix of rock classics, house, hip-hop, pop stuff...a bit of everything. Lots of people were dancing.\n\nKnow before you go....\n1. The TIP is including on the bill, but they don't total the charge slip in case you want to add more tip. So pay attention when you cash out that you don't over pay!!!\n2. Park in the Trader Joe's parking structure. It is a little bit of a walk, but it's lit well and easy to find the car.\nSee all photos from Tiffany G. for Rush Street",

OMG it's both!\n\nRush street is a local restaurant in the heart of downtown culver that turns into a dance club/lounge upstairs.\n\nCame here for a friend's bday last saturday and the place was packed! Although there isn't any cover, the line to get upstairs is pretty heinous by 10:30pm. Also, even though there is GL or fast entry for those that have bottle service, that ends around 10pm as well. If you're lucky, you can have a friend that is already upstairs in the lounge area come down and grab you, you might be able to bypass the line that way.\n\nThe upstairs area has one bar and a small outside smoking area. Honestly, the dance floor is quite tiny..and everyone is squished together like sardines.\n\nFor faster service, you probably want to go back downstairs to the bar on the first floor..there's usually a smaller wait time there.\n\nOverall, an okay place to lounge. However, if you didn't reserve a table, there's really no space for you and your buddies to chill/dance.",

As soon as me and my partner walk in the host asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar for happy hour or be seated for dinner. We responded we wanted to sit at a booth the girl who was hosting gave us a bad look and sat us down. Soo rude! Then our server kept making mistakes with our food order he didnt bring out the appetizer i requested and my partner did not get his salad and on top of that i didnt recieve the wine i ordered until i reminded him. Overall the service needs to be worked on. It can look nice from the outside and inside  but if the service is shitty and dont feel valued i guarantee i will not plan on sharing my business here again.",

Both were delicious. The fries were really truffle-y flavored and had a strong cheese taste to it which I loved! I could not stop eating them; they were sooo addicting!!

                  "review": "1 photo\nAll right I found this place on accident. My friends and I were supposed to go the Three Apples Hello Kitty event @ Royal/T nearby. Sadly though there was a super long line @ the event and we decided to leave. (Hey I like Hello Kitty and all but waiting four hours is a wee bit too much). It was roughly around 10:30 and we all hadn't had breakfast yet so we wanted a good place to eat that was nearby. Alas, here comes the Iphone yelp application came to our rescue. I did a quick search and found a couple breakfast places nearby. After a couple strolls here and there we ended up @ Rush Street. I saw there was 300+reviews about this place and a Yelp event here...so I figured this would be a good spot.\n\nIt was still decked out with Halloween decor from the night before when we got there. (Much props to the cool decor). I have to admit the whole atmosphere reminded me of some of the trendy spots in Westwood or Manhattan Beach.\n\nThere was a fair amount of people inside and outside. We decided to sit @ the patio. It was now roughly 11am and we were served the brunch menu. Some of my friends ordered from the breakfast portion of the menu. I ended up ordering the Madras veggie burger with sweet potato fries. Inside the burger was avocado, caramelized onion, arugula and mango chutney. (I guess it was the mango that sold me on ordering this. I heart mango. I also wanted the veggie burger because I had a big meat meal the night before and didn't think I wanted to indulge in more meat on this day but I wanted a burger...hehe big meat meal review at my other restaurant will be for my next review)\n\nHmm..wow..it was definitely a lot of food. The veggie burger was just average sized but there was a ton of sweet potato fries! Taste wise the veggie burger was just OK. The main patty itself seemed like a typical veggie burger you could make at home. The caramelized onion, arugula and mango chutney were a nice touch though and made this burger more unique and tasty. I would skip the avocado though. I am normally a fan of avocado but it just didn't seem to blend with the veggie burger for me.\n\nI saw a quite a few fliers about happy hour here and from the looks of it it seemed like this place is a pretty happening spot @ night. If this place was only closer to where I lived and work I probably wouldn't mind stopping by here for happy hour just to check it out. I even looked at their website and saw that it indeed seemed to be a pretty cool place to hang out...hmm so who knows maybe in the future I can do a Yelp review of the happy hour here?\n\nWell I'll end this review by saying that I had a pretty nice meal here and this place was a nice little surprise find/detour for us. Although there was no Hello Kitty here...I at least managed to enjoy a good meal and share the company of good friends at a nice spot. Thanks Yelp for pointing us to the right direction..that is why I love ya ;) Yelp.\nmadras veggie burger w/sweet potato fries",

I ordered a hot tea, which came in a dirty mug, which made me extremely nervous, but I was there and hungry so I ordered the breakfast burrito with potatoes.\n\nThe food came out after a while (which was weird because it was pretty empty), but the burrito was huge and delicious! It was full of egg, sausage and avocado, and I was glad I listened to my friend's recommendation after the first bite. The potatoes were flavorless and cold (so get tater tots instead), but overall I was full and happy after I finished my meal.\n\nParking is this area is metered, or garage based so it's going to cost you.

Maybe if you're local go here, but don't drive out of your way for it.\nBreakfast burrito with potatoes",

We also ordered the backed mac & cheese to see how it was - we were still raving about The Misfit's mac & cheese and wanted to see how this one would compare.\n\nThe mac and cheese was a good size for an appetizer.  I shared the order with my friend as we ordered burger dishes.  The macaroni was cooked well and tender, and the cheese was creamy and tasty.  I feel it doesn't have the uniqueness as The Misfit's, but is an excellent mac and cheese nonetheless, it was enjoyable.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Rush Street Dry Aged Burger with a side of fries.  In short, the burger was fantastic!  One bite and this burger instantly made it to my top 10 list!  The beef was juicy and cooked on point to my preference, the bacon was crispy, and the toppings and bun all came together to create a burst of flavor that's like a party in my mouth.  The shoestring fries were divine, cooked well and seasoned to high standards.  It was a filling, satisfying burger and fries.\n\nRush Street (from what I know) is a popular bar to hang out for your late night schmoozing.  For dinner, it is an awesome choice for anyone, especially if you are into burgers.  In my opinion, Rush Street is up there with Father's Office, The Golden State, Stout, and Slater's 50/50.  Go eat a burger and call your neighbor to meet you there so you can slap the hell out of him/her because it's so damn good!\nRush Street Dry Aged Burger\nBaked Mac and Cheese",

                  "review": "Ehhhhhhh. Went here for a friend's birthday. No line walked in Easy peezy. The dancing and outdoor lounge is upstairs. My long island was 15 dollars.. thought that was a little pricey for not a fancy hipster drink. It was pretty standard. The outdoor area was nice until people started smoking. The guys that were hitting on us didn't take the hint to go away.. which I guess is more of a reflection on the crowd then the establishment.\n\nWe mostly came to dance but the DJ was awful at mixing. The kind of mixing where your dancing and the song switches over awkwardly. The beat doesn't flow so you're just looking over to see if the dj thinks he's jamming or what... then look at your friends and you're like... what do we do now? We gave it probably a good 2/3 hours hoping maybe it would get better... but it didn't.\n\nBathrooms are small. They have amenities like lollipops lol. I guess that's fun. Best part of the night.

I attended happy hour with a friend a week ago from today and received terrible service on top of terrible drinks. I paid my bill with my debit card and left a tip for the waitress in cash. I guess she did not think that her tip was a satisfactory amount for the terrible service and bad attitude she provided, so she proceeded to fill in her own tip on the receipt where I had crossed that section out seeing as I had left a tip in cash. Upon checking my bank statement, I realized that I was over charged by a noticeable amount that I did not approve.\n\nI normally do not give bad reviews or even take the time to consider writing one. But after getting stolen from, I feel that it is necessary. I will be pressing charges on either the waitress or the restaurant itself.\n\nDO NOT DINE AT THIS RESTAURANT!",

A few tables were open with no reservations so the server just let us stay there all night. There's a bar upstairs and outside deck to get some fresh air. The upstairs got super super crowded around 12 midnight but it was very lively and overall a good atmosphere. At a certain point in the night, the kitchen only serves pizza but we managed to order truffle fries, calamari, and a burger before the cut-off. The food was very food, especially the truffle fries.\n\nI had alot of fun here",

It felt cramp and terrible just trying to pass through. I actually needed to go all the way around because things were unbearably tight.\n\nI also don't agree with the Unisex bathroom upstairs. It just ends up being women lining up and having guys trudge downstairs.\n\nI'll come here and try the food someday, but with hundreds of places to choose from in like a 3 block radius, it won't be anytime soon.",

So they end up making a new burger. Check it again before I leave except the buns aren't even warm, completely cold buns!! I asked for my burger to be cooked medium well. Once I bit into the burger nothing but red meat!!!! Since I'm back at work at this point I called to talk to the manager Matt and how this whole experience has been an in-convince to me since I got there and he states he can not do anything for me unless I bring back the burger! I would never recommend this place based on their customer service and not getting orders correct.\nVery disappointed to have this burger when I asked for medium well, clearly this isn't medium well",

Im not from Maine or SF so I can't compare them to much, however, just wow.  More crab than bread.  It was around $14 and the beer was around $9.  Little pricy, but the quality sure was there.  \n\nI did have a \"Delirium\" Beer and from one, I was buzzed--I remember laughing at nothing.

It was 4:00 the place had ONE other party sitting at a table, when we asked for a booth hostess said no they are all reserved. I said we'll be gone in an hour. She practically yelled at me NO.

                  "review": "Finally made it into Rush Street Thursday night for dinner with a couple of friends. Instead of entrees, we decided on a table full of appetizers to share. First off - our server was excellent. I have to say I enjoy blatant honesty from a server, and am more hesitant to believe them when they say EVERYTHING on the menu is amazing. Right away, when asking about cocktails and food, our server let us know what she didn't recommend - what cocktails were borderline icky, and what food didn't match the description on the menu. Of course, this made me take her recommendations for what was great much more seriously. She was fun and and attentive and really made it a nice evening.\n\nOn to the food - while I can't vouch for the entrees, I can say that the appetizers were just so-so. Descriptions on the menu did not match the food brought to the table (as the waitress warned us about the Hummus Crisp). The Heirloom Tomato and Asparagus Bruschetta was extremely disappointing, and the 'deep dish' pizza tasted burnt and bitter. We were also very bored with the Tataki nachos, which sounded scrumptious on the menu and were fairly bland. I will say that the Glazed Babyback Ribs were yummy, with an unexpected little spicy kick at the end, and the beef sliders were wonderful.\n\nWhile the food we had was only moderate, I won't say that I'm complaining because the prices were moderate as well. Had we spent a lot more on the dishes, I would say I was extremely disappointed. But you get what you pay for.\n\nMy second experience was for late night drinks with friends, and I found my favorite thing on the menu thus far - The late night thin crust pizzas! The Cajun Tasso and Pineapple was wonderful, but my absolute favorite is the White Pie and Truffle Oil - DELICIOUS. Add that, some great music, a fun crowd, and a cold beer to the end of a long day, and you can't go wrong!\n\nThe atmosphere was great - fun music, fun crowd. The hostesses were very polite (although I've read some people have had bad experiences in that department, I've been there again since and both times have had a pleasant greeting.)\n\nI will definitely be going back to Rush Street on a regular basis - not for the food, but for the nightlife. I'm willing to give the entrees a try, and even if I don't love them, I've been able to find a few things on the menu that are good enough to nibble on while having a drink with friends.\n\nP.S. One GIANT, BIG, HUGE complaint....the bathroom stalls are disgusting!!! Is no one going in there and checking them throughout the night. \"Wet\" all over the floor (hmm...wonder what THAT was) toilet paper all over...won't get into more details, but PLEASE RUSH STREET - keep your bathrooms clean! Not everyone going in there is drunk enough not to notice!!!",

I have hosted a lot of out of town friends and it's my favorite place to bring them, eat, people watch and drink. Their brunch is mighty hefty with the portions and I love the bottomless mimosas ( I do wish the price was a little more affordable). Their dinner menu has changed and I always find something good to try. I love the service here and I always get a table right as I walk in which is appreciated. Really fun place and I'm happy it has just kept getting better.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool",

Good music and lots of pretty people. Kind of a cross between a lounge and an upstairs club. I like that you can carry on a conversation easily (sans yelling) but you don't feel out of place if you find yourself dancing along to Lady Gaga for the umpteenth time :) And they stay open until 2, which is a bit of rarity on the west side.\n\nMust put a disclaimer on my rating - I have been here several times, but never actually done any of the food. Usually stuffed at that point from Akasha, Gyenari, or others...but will update of course.",

I don't think you come here solely for the food so I think the quality, selection and price are appropriate. This place is about atmosphere and socializing. They have that down pat. That being said, I think this place is better than Ford's Filling Station for food and prices. I've had snacks and the ahi burger. All have been decently tasty.\n\nService is adequate. Everything is generally adequate. While not stellar, for what this place is trying to achieve, I think it hits every mark that they need to hit:\n\nFood is decent. Service is decent. Ambience is fantastic. Location is perfect for social gatherings (near lots of offices, close to public parking structures, centrally located in LA basin, etc.). Solid choice.",

Not being a hockey fan, we didn't realize that it was the Stanley Cup Finals on the day we decided to visit. Oops! But you know what?! The staff at Rush Street were ready to accommodate us with a table toward the rear if we could be out by 9pm when they had a large party coming in. No problem!\n\nWe started off with the Tataki Nachos. They are large wonton strips with an Asian slaw and avocado and ahi. Oh so very tasty! For dinner I opted for their Dry Aged Beef Sliders. Full of flavor and so juicy and succulent that I almost ordered more but then realized I was full.\n\nThe absolute best was the drink I had that was called El Diablo. I love spicy and this mixed fruitiness and spiciness. It has Absolute Ruby Red, jalape\u00f1os, watermelon syrup, lemon and lime juice and cranberry juice. It's even garnished with sliced jalape\u00f1os. It was $12 and worth every penny.\n\nValet parking is available for $6, I believe. If not, you can park in the structure across the street off of Cardiff and Culver. There are also meters on Cardiff.",

I ate more food than was wise, and I took home more food than I actually ate. This meal was enough calories for at least 3 days.\n\nStarted things off with the mac and cheese appetizer. This thing would have been great to SHARE. But my dining buddy and I each got our own. The trouble with this thing is that if you put it in front of me, I *will* finish it. How can you not? It's cheesy and bubbling and has that crispy cheesy top. Plus it's kinda dark inside Rush Street so you can't see how greasy it is. So you can pretend it's not that greasy, until you see the pics on Yelp that were taken with flash.\n\nFor my main meal I got the braised short rib. It was in this delicious gravy that had an amazing homestyle flavor to it. Very Chicago. It was served over pappardelle noodles so it kinda had a beef stroganoff vibe almost. Unfortunately I had to take 90% of this home cause of the evil delicious mac and cheese.\n\nFinally dessert, we got both the cheesecake and the flourless chocolate cake with blueberry coulis. Both delicious. Oddly, the cheesecake was the lighter of these 2 options.\n\nWe got the tea cocktail made with Absolut tea vodka which was delicious. I also ordered a Spicy Watermelon Margarita, which was something like $8 on a Thursday night. (Tequila specials on Thursdays.) Despite the food being freaking amazing, it was really the drinks that sent it over the top for me.\n\nLove this place! Cannot wait to go back and order just 1 of the above dishes and a bunch of drinks :)",

I expected more, especially at the price. The bun was a little dry and the arugula added a weird dimension to the taste.

This is like that gooey stuff only seen in commercials, but it does not disappoint in gooeyness AND taste in real life. Between this and Baby Blues BBQ mac n cheese, I'm torn.\n\nHappy Hour is also a must since drinks and food are considerably cheaper. Just be careful because all the employees in the Culver City area come here or Culver Hotel for Happy Hour. So obviously, there's going to be a lot of bodies unless you get there early enough to grab yourself some personal space.\n\nMust Tries:\n- Watermelon Spicy Margarita: I was like what the what?!??? Then after a few of these I was still in denial of how good it is. That's how good it is.\n\n- Mac n Cheese: Obviously.\n\n- Turkey Meatloaf: Super random one but eat it with the mac n cheese instead of the mashed potatoes it comes with... heaven.\n\nAlso, all the happy hour menu food items DO NOT disappoint.

Last week a group of us hit up Rush Street for the first stop on the Culver City Summer Solstice Spiked Lemonade adventure. We made it to all the stops on the tour and tasted every other concoction and the vote was unanimous in our group of 7...Steve's Spanked Basil Lemonade was the BEST.   Not sure if it is on the drink menu yet, but I'm sure they will make it for you if you ask. .",

                  "review": "I checked out Rush Street last Saturday. I think it had only been open a couple days so the crowd was massive. The restaurant has a big and open feeling so it never felt packed. Even the rafters are exposed I think. I had dinner with my girlfriend downstairs and we started with the Ahi nacho. I know what you are thinking, but its these 4 awesome nachos loaded with veggies and some seared tuna on top. Really bizarre but very good. Most importantly. I was blown away by the burger. Father's \"omg try the burger, it only comes one way, isn't the crazy?!?\" Office has nothing on this burger. Its maybe the best expensive bar burger I've ever had. My girlfriend got the turkey burger and it was out of control tasty too. Curious about the other dishes because they don't resemble upscale bar food, but I might just always get their burger. It's perfection.\n\nWhen I went upstairs I felt like \"Finally! A restaurant/bar in Culver City that can generate a crowd.\" I've been working near downtown Culver and have been frustrated by the lack of space at all these bars. Backstage is great if you don't mind sawdust on the floor. Other than that, your choices are Ford's (no bar space and its heavily over-priced) or the wine bars which also lack sitting and standing room. Rush Street's upstairs is like a wanna-be little Vegas club. Warning: there is a stripper pole in this pseudo-VIP room. I was shocked when I saw it but people were dancing and having a good time so it didn't seem tacky. The place is so big there is an outside patio upstairs. The whole place was packed on Saturday and I couldn't believe there were people dancing and drinking late in Culver City. I have to applaud the several couches tucked everywhere and the lighting because through the loud music and people, it still felt intimate when we sat down and had a couple drinks. Will definitely re-visit for drinks and night life if they can establish a consistent scene.",

Drinks are priced appropriately and the cocktails are nice and strong. Like everyone's been saying, it's not a huge bar but at least they have dedicated booths (although unless you're going to arrive at like 7:30pm, finding an open spot is like the Grail).\n\nAnd speaking of the Grail, parking is out of hand. Girls, bring your roll-up flats in your oversized handbag because you're going to walking from the Siberia.\n\nJeez, the more I write about BFW, the worse it sounds - so why do I still want to go back this weekend?",

I like hyper sometimes, don't get me wrong.\n\nBut seriously nothing is more annoying than after a long work week...only to have a bunch of \"Ronnie from Jersey Shore\"-looking brotards (yeah google that sh*t) doing a bunch of shots they can't handle and yelling and posturing.\n\nDrinks? If you like beer and whiskey you're in for a treat.\nMusic? Jazz. Loud enough to be background music.\n\nThey don't serve food at all. Which is awesome because no nasty grease smell.

He sure looks purdy, though.\n\nI went for a friend's party on a Saturday night and it was PACKED. I'm talking elbow-to-elbow and it was probably only about 9:30 p.m. So if you want to grab a barstool or a table, it looks like you have to come before 9 p.m. And that just isn't very fun.\n\nThe interior is very much a cleaned-up, more updated version of Bigfoot Los Feliz. Same rustic, same animals on the wall, same log cabin theme. It's okay. It works in Los Feliz but it's kind of weird here mainly because of the crowd.\n\nThe crowd is a little older (30s-40s even) and a lot yuppier. There were some seriously dressed up cats here. Ladies in some Dolce and Gabbana dresses. Again, not what I expect with this log cabin decor. They would have looked more appropriate at the Standard. No one seemed douchey or anything, though, and for being incredibly crowded, everyone seemed mostly polite.\n\nThe bartenders wear little vests like they do at Copa D'Oro or the Varnish. Meaning they are trying to cater to the cocktailians?  That's the sense I got. Except almost everyone here seemed happy to just get a beer. We did try the Girl Scout Cookie and it is basically a milkshake. I think I will make fun of anyone who orders that drink, next time. The bartenders pour a VERY strong drink, though. I had a vodka & soda and it was almost all vodka. They pour them like they do at the Chalet/Griffin.\n\nParking is either valet (did not see price, sorry) or neighborhood street parking.\n\nNot a bad place for the Westside, and a good welcome to the area. I will give it another shot.",

Bartenders are always nice.  The outdoor smoking area is fab.  For some reason this bar has great flow, people just start chatting to each other, but not in an annoying \"what's your sign?\" kinda way.  I like West better than the Silverlake one, Silverlake feels like snobby beardsters camping out.  And I don't see why it's so crowded all the time.\n\nNote: finding parking can be a pain, go early.",

                  "review": "Updated review\nThe $5 happy hour drinks are stronger than they appear.  I was here twice in one week-- another Wednesday happy hour and 9 pm on a Sunday night. There was only one bartender on Wednesday but she was fast and the drinks were delicious.  I missed happy hour on Sunday but the drink specials-- $7 for a bourbon, $7 for a bourbon berry-- were delicious. There was also a bluegrass band that played Cee Lo and they were surprisingly good.\n\nIf they hired one more bartender, they would get 5 stars.  It seems hit or miss with the service but the drinks are consistently delicious.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n1/31/2011Previous review\nWednesday night, it's divey.  Friday and Saturday night, get a drink before you go because you will need some patience.  On weekends, it gets super crowded.  But if you come on a Wednesday night, you'll feel like you are with locals you really just don't want to walk the extra block home or need someone to talk to.\n\nWithout the crowd, this is a chill bar.  The atmosphere is not pretentious and they have great drinks.  I believe they have a happy hour until 9 pm.  I had a great gingery, rum, some drink (sorry, can't remember exactly; it sounds weird but it's great) from their happy hour menu for $5.  They had a bunch of specialty cocktails for $5!  But be aware of the inattentive female bartender.  Even when the men from our group arrived, still did not check whether we needed drinks.  And it was not crowded at all.  There were plenty of empty stools at the bar.  If you want a drink, you might want to have some sort of bright flag to get their attention.  \n\nAnother advice: if you can walk, ride your bike, bus, or carpool here, it's the best option.  Avoid driving at all cost because not only should you not drink and drive but parking is a huge pain.  Though you might finally find a spot on the south side of Venice Boulevard, it is not advisable because 1) you probably should not cross the huge and busy intersection after drinking (because that's just suicidal) and 2) there are lots of cops and hiding places.",

I had 3 in one night the other day, and I have to say, I get bored with drinks pretty easily (during one sitting), but I kept wanting to have more. It was really delicious, and great if you're into citrusy drinks.  \n\nThe staff are usually really friendly and nice, I've had some issues with the security (they probably thought I was underage, I don't blame them because I'm a little Asian with a baby face, but hey, they could at least a little nicer.

The other day I called Bigfoot West last minute because I had used their online reservation system and never received a response. Vince answered the phone and explained to me that the person who typically operates the online system had been in the hospital recently, but he told me I still should have been notified. I asked if he could possibly get me a reservation for that night and he told me that usually the bar doesn't like to reserve for parties under 15 people (my party was between 10 and 12) but that he would check the tables for me. Sure enough, he was able to pull a couple of tables and a booth together for my birthday. Vince made sure I was happy and taken care of on my birthday, and I am absolutely grateful. We all had an awesome time, the decor inside is so fun and the drinks were outstanding. I ordered the Bourberry all night! Also, the bartenders went out of their way to get me some pickle brine from the back of the house for my all time favorite pickleback shot. Bigfoot West goes above and beyond, and none of it would've been possible without Vince. Thank you thank you thank you!",

The front door to the museum remains closed even in the best weather, so do not be fooled if the building looks like it's closed.\n\nThere is a 'suggested donation' of $8, which is more of a required admission fee, but I don't know if I've ever spent $8 better.\n\nThis place was the Mary Poppins bag of museums. Just when you thought the exhibits were over, another hallway would open up leading to another wing of the museum featuring miniature statues built in the eyes of sewing needles. Other notable exhibits included: microscopic mosaics made using the scales of butterfly wings, a variety of illustrated superstitions and a surprisingly large collection of string figures a-la-Cat's Cradles.\n\nThe best part of the museum by far is the rooftop courtyard at the end of the museum where you can enjoy complementary tea and cookies. Make sure that you don't miss the courtyard (home to several beautiful birds), it's located through a door at the back of the cafe.  \n\nMinus one star because a lot of the exhibits are out of order and many of the descriptions associated with the various exhibits do not adequately explain the context of the exhibits themselves. Usually I would give a museum less stars for these reasons, but they somehow end up adding to the oddball quality of the adventure.",

I recommend you stop reading my review and all others now and read them after you have gone.  \n\nFor those of you that did go and didn't get it, this place is genius.  Don't you get that basically everything in the place is fake?  My friend and I went and laughed our asses off.  It was brilliant.  At first we were thoroughly confused and didn't get it.  The introductory video basically just rambles on about nothing and makes you feel stupid until you start walking around and realize this place is f***ing with you big time.  At first they confuse you with some guy who built bridges and there is a novel of information to read that makes you feel like you are in the most boring place in the world.  This is the set up that is so great. Then it continues to things that could be real you think?  Once we got to the room where the displays were so ridiculous we started questioning things.  I think the first hint was the case with the mirror, the fan and the gloves that seemed to have no reason for being there.  We started laughing at that point, then we found dark displays where you put your hands inside only to find packages of peeps in them.  Either this was on purpose or someone who got the concept left them there, but this is when we couldn't stop laughing.  Next was the room of crazy things people collected from yard sales.  I mean really, how did people not realize at this point that you were in a circus of crap?  \n\nMy friend's favorite room was the trailer park manufacturers, the paintings of the space dogs and the barking wolf display.  I loved the cats cradle rooms and the holographic instructions on how to create different cats cradles.  \n\nAs we walked around we were wondering what other people were thinking and why everyone was so stoic and really trying to read all of the descriptions of the items - haha, don't waste your time reading or maybe do, but it's all bullsh**.  \n\nThe 'out of order' displays were hysterical, clearly they were never in order and were meant to confuse you even more.  Or the displays that simply didn't work and weren't meant to.\n\nWe left some trash behind in one of the trailer park displays because it just seemed like the right thing to do.  \n\nThen the tea room and the outdoor patio with the violinist really topped it off nicely - as if we had just had some incredible cultural experience roaming around the museum.  We MADE sure we had tea and cookies and please also notice the DOVES!  \n\nI've never felt so stoned in my life without ingesting any kind of drug!\n\nThis place is AWESOME!",

Almost nothing about this \"museum\" has anything with the Jurassic period and very little technology. This is less of a museum and more of an art gallery. Little to no explanation of the exhibits leave you wondering. I wish I could give this place a better review but there really isn't anything to review. The tea lounge and patio on the roof is pretty neat I guess but really that's stretching. Only come here if you have no expectations of learning anything or finding anything fascinating. If you're okay with looking at someone's collection of junk for $8 then definitely check it out. To sum it up, it's a complete waste of time and not worth the drive from LBC\nUseful\nFunny\nCool",

Also, don't be shy; you'll get the most of your experience by peeking into every peephole/eyeglass and exploring the nooks and crannies. I saw a lot of unexpected things. I won't go into detail with spoilers, but it was (mostly) in a cool kind of way not in a I-wish-I-could-unsee-what-I-just-saw kind of way.\n\nOne of the coolest things I saw where these amazing wooden chairs shaped like brains. The guy at the front desk told me that they were made by Gregg Fleishman, who has a gallery nearby full of cool stuff.\n\nAlso, check out the Center For Land Use Interpretation two doors down. It's their sister center, but with free admission. It's tiny, but worth checking out if you're already around the area.\n\nI suggest parking in one of the free 90 min. parking lots a couple of blocks away, if you're like me and street parking scares you too. One such lot is around the block from the Honey Kettle fried chicken joint.",

The museum is in my 'hood, so after reading the various descriptions and reviews I decided to go because it sounded like my kind of place. It IS my kind of place.\n\nCabinet of curiosities it is, literally and very much in the spirit of. People who don't understand what a cabinet of curiosities is historically may not \"get\" this place. It's not a museum in the sense of every item scientifically curated and validated as \"authentic\" and/or \"valuable\" monetarily. It is simply a place which exhibits interesting things, some having historical value, some having artistic value, and some having both. It's a quirky mix of all kinds of things from figures carved in the eye of a needle to paintings of Russian space dogs to intricate cat's cradles complete with holographic instructions.\n\nI liked being offered tea in the tea room, which has interesting architecture and Russian artifacts (loved the samovar and balalaika), and I almost think my favorite part of the visit was the roof garden - delightful! A small Oriental (in the 19th C sense) garden full of greenery, birds and music.\n\nThe one thing I didn't appreciate, and would give a caveat about - the entire first floor is dimly lit, and I understand why - many of the artifacts are very fragile and light-sensitive. But there is dim and there is BLACK, and a few areas of the first floor are downright dangerous for visitors of any age or mobility. Steps up, steps down, covered electrical cords and wooden stools are nasty surprises. Honestly, I would think the city/county or OSHA would have safety issues with some of the first floor.",

I have to squint to see what's on the tiny old screen because it's so dark in there.  A guy that sounds like he's from the haunted house Disney ride starts narrating...he goes from random subject to another random subject not linking anything he's saying to form the question everyone is asking...WHY THE HELL IS THIS MUSEUM HERE, WHAT IS ITS PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO STORE OLD RECORDS AND WHY DO THEY KEEP REFERENCING THE LOWER JURASSIC PERIOD AKA WHEN DINOSAURS ROAMED.  I still haven't found the answer to that question.  This museum seems like the stepchild that everyone forgot about...the exhibits they have are the most random topics and it almost seems like it's purely to store dead scientists work that the affiliated organization didn't want to store anymore.  Half the videos and dialogues don't work.  They play creepy music, it's hot and muggy, hipsters breed here, and dust collects on mostly everything.  \nIt was definitely an interesting experience in that I got to laugh hysterically with my boyfriend after exiting at how ridiculous it was.  If you have nothing else to do and want a good laugh and an eye strain from reading in the dark, this is your place.",

Or you can just embrace it and go along with the flow.\n\nIf you love the quirky and eccentric, make your way here, straight away.  It's like wandering through a modern version of a Victorian sideshow.  \n\nI recommend getting in as early as possible.  When the museum is mostly empty, it's quite eerie, and there's an additional dimension to its oddity that isn't there when you're struggling through other gawkers.\n\nThe tea room is great fun.

                  "review": "Every time I see a post from someone getting ready to visit the L.A. area and is seeking suggestions of sights to see, every other comment names off the Getty Center or the Museum of Jurassic Technology. And almost always in naming off the MJT, there's a note about it being a \"best kept secret\" or something of the like.\n\nMJT is worth A visit.\n\nWhile I agree that it's filled with many odd or curious things, it's not really a repeat visit sort of place. Especially if you're claustrophobic or afraid of the dark.\n\nThe rooms are small and cramped, and often I worried I might accidentally knock something over. If there's more than 3 people in a room at one time, it gets hard to move or look at anything. All the while you're almost completely in the dark guided by the light on the displays.\n\nHonestly much of it is rather forgettable. I remember an exhibit about trailer homes, a human horn, and miniatures that fit in a needle's eye. Going through this labyrinth-like gallery is like reading through BoingBoing's back-entries.\n\nOne thing that seems to appeal to people is the idea that you have to look for this often-easy-to-miss storefront for it and ring the bell to be let in, lending itself to the idea that the patrons are in a secret society. You feel like you're in on something.\n\nMJT is just another case of the Emperor's New Clothes. So many are quick to hypnotically agree that it's wonderful, one of a kind, outside of the box, and a must see. This is possibly because they don't want to feel like the odd man out for not seeing what they think other hip and fantabulous people around them are seeing. This is evidenced by all the ambiguous 5-star reviews that don't really tell you anything.",

After that, we had Georgian tea+biscuits+assorted nuts+dried fruit in the Tula tea house which is modelled after TsarNicholasII's study at the Winter Palace in St P.\n\nChecked out the exhibits after tea and they transported me back to the 17th century before museums were separated into art,history etc. Be prepared to be impressed, amazed, puzzled- I mean where else can you find an exhibit dedicated to the dogs who went to spade courtesy of SovietUnion?!!\n\nWe were also laughing outright at the earnestness of some of the letters in the exhibit of Letters Sent to Mt Wilson Observatory in the 1900s.\n\nWe left the museum feeling that we've just come out from a portal! A must visit-whether you stay for 1/2 hr or 3 hrs!!!",

Not only are half of the artifacts difficult to describe in a coherent way, but it would ruin the fun of the discoveries you make whilst journeying through the different rooms.  And believe me, there's way more rooms here than you would picture behind that unassuming green door.  It's dark and byzantine and everything is well-labeled.  You just have to have a curious nature about you in order to appreciate the bizarreness of the whole endeavour.\n\nThis museum is not for everyone.  You either get it or you don't.  Thought-provoking doesn't begin to describe it.  The whole time I was thinking, 'so this is what it was like when P.T. Barnum had a museum!' If you know the stories behind the feejee mermaid or the egress, then you will get it.  If you don't, then no amount of tea and cookies upstairs will wash away the befuddlement....",

I can definitely recommend that experience, but visiting today as a sober patron, it was just as enjoyable.\n\nAmbling through, I felt off-kilter, which is part of the charm. My companion said he thought the place had a bit of a haunted house feel.\n\nThe lighting is such that you strain your eyes to read the text accompanying exhibits, and the sound on everything is either so poor that you'll think your hearing is failing you, or at a level that you can hear it two rooms away.\n\nIt's much larger than when I last went, and there is a more even mix of the absurdly unreal and the interestingly historical. My favorite bit is still the bat caught in the lead wall - I don't know why - but also I could spend all day in the room of folk remedies.\n\nBe sure to go upstairs to have some tea.

At first, nobody really knows what to make of the place; they wander the dreary, under-lit halls and stare blankly at the perplexing \"exhibits\" (crackpot letters to the Mt. Wilson Observatory, a pair of mice on a slice of toast; X-ray photographs of flowers, a collection of decaying dice, and many many more) .  After half an hour or so, they either shrug their shoulders and ask to leave, or they burst out laughing.  If they laugh, I know I've found a true kindred spirit.\n\nIs it a museum?  Is it an elaborate piece of performance/installation art?  Are the exhibits a collection of broken meaningless junk, or are they simply far too sophisticated for a cretin like me to appreciate?  There's enough evidence to argue either way. On one hand, you have stained glass \"paintings\" made of butterfly scales and microscopic statues of the Pope and Goofy on pinheads -- genuinely cool stuff.  On the other, you have the scholarly \"narrations\" delivered over old-school telephone handsets that you can listen to for 10 minutes before you realize that they're completely incomprehensible.  The ambiguity is what makes it brilliant.\n\nYou're not for everybody, MJT, but nor should you be.  You're a beautiful and unique snowflake, and I love you just the way you are; don't ever change!",

I have a semblance of a clue, but that semblance is foggy at best.  Just go.  Listen to insane old ladies wail tribal chants while you attempt various Cat's Cradle maneuvers.  Look at microscopic sculptures on pinheads.  Shudder at medical superstitions from the olden days.  Sneak photos of you and your equally-confused museum-going pals looking befuddled at every turn but loving every minute of it.  Then ascend a rickety staircase and drink lemony tea and eat sugar cookies in a wash of hazy afternoon sun.\n\nThe Russian space dog portraits struck a poignant chord, but I could've done without the mice-on-toast.",

I'm delighted they did, but  if I had to give any additional advice it would be this:\n\nThe museum is dirt cheap its only a $3-5 donation per person to get in so even the guy who sleeps on your couch can tag along,  Start off with the right side of the museum where you will find the permanent collection. Make sure to take your time walking through, its easy to walk right past corridors and rooms altogether. (Oh and After you go up the stairs, yes you can open the door on the right.)  And I shouldn't have to tell you this tip the damn tea lady. Anyhow loved this place and I hope you will or already do too.",

Its maze like structure has a treasure-hunt feel, while the tucked away exhibits in dim lighting make for an early 20th century experience as if i had traveled in space and time to another world altogether.\n\nUnique visual treasures in each room made me feel like i was trapped inside a curiosity cabinet that had been carefully curated to seduce and inspire its trespassers.\n\nWords that come to mind: Funeral Home, Einstein, post war Budapest, Labrinth, mad scientist laboratory, Russian Space center, Freak Show, Circus, gypsies, genius, cavernous, hypnotic, gloom, doom, dreams, dark, macabre, perverse, discovery, botany, interactive, curiosity, antiques, art, photography, lithographs, journey into the mind, secrets, shock, mystery, magic.\n\nUpstairs there is a tea room, where a voluptuous Russian lady appears from behind a curtain to offer you tea. It's a complete sensory experience, from the ritual of the pouring of the tea to the enjoyment of your warm brew in the Islamic-architecture inspired rooftop patio filled with fountains and antique bird cages with miniature birds chirping;  a clear sky looking down on you as you sip into your warm cup and zen out forgetting you are in Los Angeles for a moment.\n\nPRACTICAL INFORMATION:\n-Street parking (meters are only 1hour and that will NOT be enough time) better park in Downtown Culver City lots just across Venice Blvd.\n- museum is donation based, $5\n- though most things are part of the permanent collection, there are \"special\" curated exhibits.\n- tea room is free but bring enough money for tip.\n- films are screened hourly in the tea room\n- once you think you've seen it all, you probably havent the place is twice as big as it appears from the outside and just when you think you've come to an end, another door opens and voila...another room of curiosities anxiously awaits your exploration.\n- Museum is open thursday through sunday (thursday 2pm-8pm and all other days noon-6pm).\n- museum is free though it runs on donations. Suggested donations are $2-$5 depending on what you can give.\n- great place to bring a date, the cavernous crevices and hallways make for intimate connections that invoke both mystery and romance.\n- does not compare to anything or any place you may have been to and simply cannot be described but rather must be experienced.\n- if you are an artist or a creative person this is a perfect place to seek and find inspiration.",

Anyways, I did enjoy myself and had fun going through the many exhibits with my friend.  Some was very interesting while others were really dull with long and drawn out descriptions.  In the end, for 5 bucks, it's worth a visit... especially since you get tea and cookies upstairs!",

This museum simply incredible. I recommend coming here early because it is amazing when you're the only one here. My favorite room in this whole museum is the roof-top garden. As I was sitting on a beautiful stone bench, listening to birds chirping, the accordion playing and the small fountain near my feet, I felt totally calm and at peace. When you step onto the roof, you completely forget that you're in Culver City! For a second or two, I honestly thought I was in India. To be completely honest, I really don't care if you visit this place or not, and I don't think the owner does either. It was his dream, and his vision, and as I watched him play the accordion on his very own rooftop garden, he looked completely content. But just know, if you don't go here, you'll be missing out on a lot.",

Some are interesting (the tiny sculptures that fit inside the eye of a needle are amazing), others not (x-rays of flowers, yawn).  Some just leave you stratching your head (trailer park treasures, decaying dice).  Many of the exhibits are heavily text based so be prepared to read a lot while standing.  A fair number of the \"mechanical\" exhibits were out of order.  And who knows how much of this stuff is completely made up.  There is definitely some sleight of hand involved in the presentation of the material.  Lots of dim lighting, eerie music, and narrow hallways.  They are definitely trying to give the impression that you are entering some kind of cloistered, secret place.  You definitely feel like you are entering a different world than the one that exists on the street right outside, which is probably the coolest aspect of coming here.  It's a place to get lost.  I was annoyed at constantly bumping into people.  It's a small space with narrow hallways, and it was crowded on the Saturday that I went.  I don't understand the deal with their bathroom.  I can't believe that anyone ever uses it.  It has a glass outer door (i.e. see thru) and then a stall door that has a panel missing on the bottom that someone can easily look through.  I really had to go but couldn't do it there.  I went down the street to In N Out and used their bathroom instead.  Parking is also a hassle.  You can find free parking in the residential areas off of Main Street around the corner the museum.",

I ordered the papaya salad and Tom kha kai soup w tofu. The papaya salad was enough for three people, and had fresh shrimp no dried shrimps. The soup was enough for two or three people, and the tofu had a nice flavor. I would not recommend the Thai iced coffee here.\n\nI came here a second time with a friend and dined in. I was so embarrassed because the portions were so small and the quality was terrible. We ordered four things. The papaya salad came out and it was in a shockingly small bowl and mostly just juice. We each barely had enough for two bites each.\n\nThen the soup came out, the exact soup and size that I ordered before. The bowl was so small that the tofu was piled on top. The tofu had not been simmered as it was white and bland, as if they just stuck it on top.\n\nThe $15 soft shell crab was basically just the shell of the crab. It was very over-fried and terribly salty ( don't order this). We had to ration the rice just to palate this salty disappointment. Since the portions were so small we had to order another dish. This dish, the pad se ew came out burnt! You could even smell the burnt smell. It tasted not only burnt but super oily.",

We dined in, I think that's the best way to consume as the crab is deep-fried.\n\nWill come again! and again with friends. Thank you!!",

For dinner, we ordered\nTom Kah Soup (Large), Bankok Roll and Pineapple Fried Rice.\nThe atmosphere was small, intimate (yet simple) and dimly lit.\n\nThis review would be '5 stars' if (3) things did not occur. The service waitress ignored 'nut allergies' when specifying 'no nuts' during the order. After receiving the rolls and rice dish, shortly after we noticed nuts in both. When she returned to the table, she did not exhibit an offer for replacement, just an \"ooh, so sorry\" and convenient walked away as to avoid the issue and or reprimand from her management. To improvise I dug out all the visible and buried nuts in both dishes. Not only that, she charged an extra $2 for shrimp in the soup w/o any mention during the order. It was our first time there and pretty much overlooked the $2 extra before paying the bill. However, I did notice it later. Anyhow, I had already decided a steep turn on her tip. But, the food was great! Would return for better service and a proper tip for service. All the other staff was very nice, cordial and acknowledging during entrance and exit.",

The food here is so savory and delicious, with the owner in the kitchen preparing dishes from her Mother's recipes. The ingredients are very fresh, the staff is upbeat and friendly and the decor is very welcoming. They can prepare the food any way you like, from mild to spicy. I usually get the Chicken Pho, Spicy Papaya Salad, Pork Jerky and Stir-Fry Broccoli. For dessert try the coconut ice cream, it's incredible!\n\nI hardly write reviews but I highly recommend BKK101!",

When I boyfriend went to go pick it up, they hadn't even started the order. This had been 40 minutes past the order time. When I called the manager to ask why, she said it's rush hour. At 9PM. On a Sunday.\n\nshe actually hung up on me. And canceled my order and didn't even let me know. My boyfriend called me and said that she canceled so I called her back, and she said she can't do business with me because I'm rushing her. I don't think asking for your food to be done when promised, is considered rushing.\n\nthey treated my boyfriend like he was a peasant begging for food. i would never give this place a dime and i look forward to seeing their doors shut permanently when i drove down venice blvd.\ni left a review of my awful experience on their facebook page and someone mysteriously reported it as \"having nudity.\" LOL.\nUseful 16\nFunny 1\nCool\nGiftzy S.\nBusiness Owner",

The raisins in it definitely gave just the right amount of sweetness combined with the spice of the curry.\n\nMy friend got the red curry and that was also delicious. Beware the spicy is definitely really spicy. She got brown rice on the side and it was the good brown rice (kind of like wild rice looking)\n\nWe also got the veggie rolls that come with a great sweet and sour mustard sauce.\n\nAll in all great place and definitely is my new go to take out! Also as a note the portions were big enough that I'm eating my leftovers for lunch the next day!",

Other people came in and order to-go while I was there, and they got their food and left way before me. I kept asking how long my food would be, and I never really got an answer.\n\nThe staff kept pushing out to-go and delivery orders. They shouldn't commit to so many online platforms and orders since they clearly can't handle it.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nGiftzy S.\nBusiness Owner\n10/8/2017\nIm so sorry that you had to wait for that long.\n\nWe just wanted to let you know that if you pick a \"future order\" time in the EAT24 app it might be earlier than we can get the order processed. We would like Eat 24 to provide us with an update to your time in the app but until that's possible we need to make sure and call you. Usually we confirm 40-60 mins on the weekend for pick up when we are super busy. One thing about future orders is we have no option to confirm/change your pick up time.\n\nI really apologize that you had to wait that long. Next time I will call you to confirm with you if we're busy in the kitchen.\n\nThank you for your understanding. We really appreciate your time and for choosing us.  We really hope to see you soon.",

And my 2 Yelp friends Akiko T (for dinner) and Anthony N (for dessert only) rates this a 2 star.\n\nWell this review is based on Happy Hour only.  Debbie W. and our friend Dianne came here before the Yelp Elite Event for lite bites and cocktails since we were all starving.  \n\nWe decided to sit outside since it was a nice fall evening, and since the outdoor patio had heat lamps.  We had to wait for sometime before some came to take our drink order.  And there was really no excuse for the wait since the place wasn't very busy at all.  \n\nDebbie and I ordered 42 Below vodka cocktails (Deb with cranberry, and me with tonic).  The HH price was $6 a drink!  Nice price.  We both loved our cocktails.  Not skimpy on the alcohol fo sho!\n\nWe ordered 3 appetizers to share.  This fried rice ball served with a bolognese sauce, the prosciutto with caramelized onion pizza, and the calamari served with a marinara sauce.  All 3 appetizers were good.  My favorite in order was the pizza, calamari and the rice ball.  \n\nUgo has gelato!  My fav.  But we had to pass on the gelato since we had to head on over across the street for the Yelp Elite Bad Hair Day Event.\n\nI may have to also pass on having dinner here since my Yelp bud Akiko had a bad experience here.  But for a decent Happy Hour, this place isn't bad at all.",

                  "review": "3 photos\nWe were on our way to Tender Greens next door, but they were closed for the holidays. Walking back to the car dejectedly, we spied delicious looking desserts in a cute cafe atmosphere. Wonder if they have real food? So we decided to wander in and take a look at the menu. Salads and pastas and enterees (oh my!) Sweet. Lets grab a table.\n\nHad to start with the cheese plate. I'm a sucker for cheese. This one had 5 different cheeses, and although the waiter didn't know what they were, he made it a mission to find out. Buffalo mozzarella (my least favorite as it was the consistency of taffy), gorgonzola (excellent, not too bluey, but just the right amount of tang), fontina (simply excellent), smoked mozzarella (excellent, not too smoky) and castelmagno (a little too mild).\n\nThe entrees came out before we were done with the cheese plate, which would normally be fine, but because we were in the cafe section instead of the restaurant section, there wasn't enough room on the small table for all the plates. We played tetris with the plates and got most of them to fit.\n\nI got the Pesce Bianca - a white fish topped with a lemony, garlic, white wine sauce, eerily reminiscent of a dish I make occasionally at home. It was perfectly cooked. The side of spaghetti noodles had tons of large chunks of roasted garlic that were just incredible.\n\nMy friend got the meat lasagna. I can't vouch for it as I don't eat red meat, but she said it was very tasty.\n\nRemember I mentioned the delicious looking desserts earlier? Well for once I actually saved room! It was a really tough decision as they had about 30 kinds of gelato, including many that were dairy and fat free, along with another case filled with pastry type desserts. We were allowed to taste whatever gelato's we wanted. I tried the hazlenut/pistachio/chocolate and the tiramisu. My friend tried the pumpkin and the green apple. They were very good, but it was a cold night, so I opted instead to get the real tiramisu, which is served in a chocolate cup. My friend went for the creme brulee. The tiramisu was very good. Sweet, but not too sweet. And the chocolate cup made the dessert really fun. The creme brulee unfortunately was not as good. It had been torched earlier and was cold top to bottom. Creme brulee is really only good if it is freshly torched.\n\nThey would have gotten 3 stars because of the creme brulee, but the service bumped them up a notch to a solid 4. I will definitely be back.",

The Granchio Salad has lemony crab meat on a bed of baby mixed greens; the Limonata is only two bucks; and the four pasta dishes at the top of the menu -- including the Lobster Ravioli -- are all spicy-saucy loveliness. But you come here for the specialized Gelato desserts really, and as a man who has been to Venice, Italy and Paris, France... I have to say that the creations here are the most marvelously stupendous. BEST: THE BACIO DI DAMA SUNDAE with vanilla and hazelnut sweet cream cushioned by Italian biscuit cookies is ecstasy.\n\nThis classy cafe, with breezy but cozy outdoor patio, is interesting enough that if they ever made a movie about it called \"The Ugo Story\" then... I wouldn't mind watching at least part of it.",

This was once one of my favorite restaurants in a newly developing downtown Culver City.  I think they're a victim of over expansion.  They expanded from just Ugo to include a wine bar to their right and then a cafe to their left.  The distinction between the restaurants was hard to determine and it started to seem like they had the same number of customers and servers just spread out over three restaurants.\n\nI think they knew something was wrong so they tried to rework their menus and they have combined all three restaurants.  They got rid of my favorite dish (the ravioli with bolognese), stopped serving happy hour at the cafe to the left, and decided to stop slicing their pizzas (they say that's how they do it in Italy, so it must be good).  \n\nI've been back 3 or 4 times since the changes.  The pizza, the salad, and the pasta now are just blah and prices have gone up to pay for renovations.  Service is inconsistent, it's sometimes fine but sometimes unbearably slow.\n\nYou used to have to wait for a table here but now I think other people are feeling similarly because the best thing going for Ugo now is that whereas every place else in Culver City is crowded you can almost always get a table quickly here.  \n\nI can't get myself to give them two stars because we have a lot of history together but I've told my wife to remind me that I don't want to go to Ugo's again.  There are too many other tasty nearby options.\nUseful 3\nFunny 1\nCool 3",

Service & staff were \"just OK\". The food, however, was nothing to write home about. We ordered the prosciutto pizza. It came topped with arugula and appeared to be house-made in the classic rustic form, which I actually like. The crust, however, killed it for me. It was not crispy at all. The pizza's flavors were ok, but the crust was chewy and tough, and we even had a hard time cutting slices into it with our knives. It was like cutting rubber. We finally resorted to 'scoring' the pizza as best as we could with our knives, and then using our hands to pull the pieces apart.\n\nWe also shared the Caprese salad with their house-made mozzarella, and that was tasty. Then again, it's hard to mess up something as simple as a Caprese salad, no?\n\nWe finished off our meal with what the restaurant called a raspberry cake, which turned out to be a full-on chocolate cake with chocolate icing and a thin layer of macerated raspberries in the middle. I wouldn't per se call that a \"raspberry\" cake, but it wasn't bad nor was it good. My friend ordered an espresso, yet they came out with a cappuccino. I ordered a regular coffee, and never even saw my coffee... Staff was nice, but clueless.",

The managers name is Josh and we were also verbally attacked for no reason other than asking for our card to be honored when his waitress admitted leaving it in a machine.

My friend went up to the waitress to make sure she didn't get into trouble at which point the manager accused us of scamming him on a 45$ card no less.\n     When we insisted on a credit to our card he refused and wanted to call the police. In all my years of wine tastings , restaurants etc I've never met a more paranoid, rude, clueless manager in my life.

Especially after I heard about the happy hour.  Happy hour at wine bar = me there.  So, a turn of events led to me and my sugar being over in the Culver City area at the appropriate hour with no dinner prospects in sight,  I thought to myself, \"By Jove, we must go to Ugo Wine Bar!\"\n\nBoy am I happy we did.  We were greeted at the door by the lovely bartender/server Taren.  I was in awe of the enomachine things that dispense wine by the ounce via card, but Taren said that they weren't part of the happy hour deal.  \"Cool, cool, I'm cool\" I think.  Then she handed me the happy hour menu and I saw to my delight that that there were a number of delectable wines on offer.  I ordered the Malbec ($5 - hh price) and we were on our way!\n\nThe room is nice too.  There are a variety of table configurations and comfy chairs.  Even though is is a smallish space, it feels big because of the big windows and high beamed ceilings.  And they show old black and white movies on the wall!  Culver city movie legacy?\n\nThe happy hour menu of food was really a bargain.  We ordered two platters:  a 6 salumi, and a 6 formaggio.  We had Taren choose the cheeses and the meats and my group liked them all.  Great value and they were the most popular plates.  We also ordered the dates which were really nice and a pizette which was good too.\n\nMy overall feeling is that I really enjoyed the wine bar, and that the service (David fixed our wobbly table AND sliced the bread thinner upon request!), food and wine were excellent.  I will so be back!\nSo chocolate! Get with vanilla gelato!",

When she cut the scallop in half, I could see it was still rare in the middle, just how I like my scallops.\n\nI got the sausage oricchette. I thought it was pretty good. The pasta was a little bit more al dente than I would have liked but once I broke up the oricchette and ate them individually, it was better. It wasn't anything I couldn't make myself but it was reasonably priced at $11.50 with a goodly amount of leftovers (though I ate all the sausage, spinach and red bell pepper before having the pasta boxed).\n\nI loved my iced tea! They brewed it fresh so it took a bit longer than usual to get it but I thought it was worth it.\n\nWe were too full for gelato but I don't think I would have gotten it as I didn't like the look of chocolate syrup drizzled on the gelato. Was it pre-drizzled or was it part of the gelato? And if so, why so many flavors have chocolate swirls?\n\nWe came in a little after 9 and were seated inside. The place was pretty packed but the wine bar next door was even more packed. I can see why this place is so popular for a casual date or lunch on the patio.",

I ended up arriving first, and even though it was a tad busy, and the rest of my party was not present, I was seated right away.  This, for me is huge.  I've been places where I've had all but one or two in a party and the place won't seat us.  \n\nWhile I waited a few minutes, I enjoyed the bread which was tasty, and the waitress was plesant and attentive. The atmosphere was plesant, and I never felt awkward sitting at the table alone.  \n\nThe menu is pretty good, lots of pastas which I am a huge fan of.  As Kate E. said, our waitress very thoughtfully plated our shared salad, and once we ordered the food came out quickly.  We also shared a bottle of wine that was pretty tasty for $23.  \n\nGreat place, can't wait to go back.",

So three stars b/c some people like bland food. I think The Olive Garden has more menu options, but I have a foggy memory.\n\nThe Servers' attire threw me off. It's sloppy compared to the look of the place.\n\nWe went around to the Washington side, where they have the gelatos, which also looked uninspired, but I still wanted some. The gelatos at Whole Foods looked better. I had the Romeo & Juliet, which is probably the best part of the meal, so 3.5 stars for that.\n\nI am interested in giving the wine bar area a try. It's wine.",

We were going to go to Tender Greens next door, but it was completely empty and the workers appeared to be doing some unpacking or something.\n\nI should also mention that our crappy dinner cost $50 for two.

I couldn't have been happier if I'd actually been in the Village or Italy itself..because then I couldn't have walked to that cool Giant Robot exhibit after!  \n\nArriving 2 hours early for the show, my buddy and I decided to grab some dinner.  Taking advantage of the lovely weather, we walked around Culver City, quickly coming to the downtown area. Nice in that yuppy/tourist/don't-want-to-live-but-really-like-to-visit way.  I really don't leave the echo park/silverlake area enough.  Wandering the block, we window shopped the menus a la goldilocks [too expensive, suspiciously inexpensive, too crowded, too empty]..and then, Cafe Fuego: just right!  \n\nThe hostess had that perfect italian mama thing going on.  Nice service, although our swiss (?) waitress felt a bit odd!  He had the Fettuccini Primavera (light, fresh vegetables and delicious just-made fettuccini noodles), I had the Rigatoni alla Sorrentina (Smoked mozzerella, lightly grilled eggplant and a lightly spicy sauce).  We each had 2 imported italian sodas, no appetizers; walked out stuffed, with leftovers for $30.  Although it looked crowded, I'll probably be back for the adjadcent wine-tasting-bar soon.\n\n...and yes, the Scion Gallery was about a 15 minute walk away..which I NEEDED after emptying those 2 bread baskets, thank you very much!",

The price was reasonable and the food was amazing..service was 5 star and we had a blast..a few members of our group are beer drinkers and they were easily and happily accomodated..\n\nWe will be back probably for happy hour and definitely for more evenings on the town..",

The service was great despite what other reviews say. I didn't have to wait either time and everyone was friendly there.  I will be back sometime to try the wine bar and gelato since I didn't get a chance the first time.\n\nTheir Bolognese sauce is out of this world! Loves the mini Arancini! You don't find those often on a restaurant menu. I have shared a few desserts here and they were all just as good as they look.  One tip though, their menu on-line doesn't always match what they are serving at the caf\u00e9. It seems to be missing a few dishes that I had read when I was there. Same goes for the dessert menu.\n",

Food is average, service is average (if you are lucky). But yet I keep going back just because it is handy for a movie and I like the Fig pizza. It is hard to screw up Italian. But no angel hair pasta - really?  At an Italian restaurant, I find that really odd.",

I have to agree with other yelpers that there were quite a few wines that were out and the selection wasn't that great. They had a wine from the McManis Family Vineyard that I enjoyed and ending up just cashing out on that wine. After you get a little tipsy, then it's time for some dinner. The food was lackluster. I ordered the Penne alla Boscaiola, and I was hoping for a nice rich pink sauce, but it fell pretty flat on flavor. The gelato helped wash everything down though. There are so many flavors, and you can go sample them over at the counter and then make your selection at the table. I was a fan of the Italian Love Potion, which mostly tasted of cinnamon and also the melon (but not together). Throughout the night, the server let us do our thing, which was much appreciated. However, when he came over to the table, he was pretty relaxed and came across as apathetic. So all in all, it definitely could have been better, but I had fun.",

Anyway, I went with my friend and we were seated right away. The restaurant was about half full, but for some reason it took 35 minutes to even have a waitress come to our table. We kept telling other waiters around us that we did not have a waitress but no one ever came.\n\nFinally the manager came and gave us bread, and took our drink/food orders.\n\nIt took 30 minutes after that for our 2 waters and 2 blue moons to come out to us. And about 45 minutes for our food.\n\nI ordered the veggie panini. The GRILLED tomatoes were freezing cold and you could tell by the way the mozzarella cheese looked that it has been sitting out.\n\nMy friend order a simple plate of calamari and it was dry, old, and not seasoned. I tasted it and felt sick. I could go to Ralph's and buy a bag of frozen calamar, microwave it and even that would taste better than this did.\n\nWe took two bites of our food and left.

The food was tasty - i ordered the Grilled Halibut with side veggies and grilled asparagus and my bf ordered the Fillet Mignon with grilled veggies.  The Fillet (with some kind of marsala sauce) with mushrooms were a tad salty but the flavor was nice.  The best part is sitting outside in the evening, and ordering from their extensive dessert list.  I ordered the gelato and italian cheesecake and it reminded me of sitting in a cafe outside somewhere in Europe.\n\nA must try when you are in the downtown Culver City area.",

I seriously used to dream about eating it. My friends either had their veal or lamb (not sure which one is was, only that I won't eat either because I'm a dork who feels guilty about eating cute animals) and said it was outta control delicious. Although that may not be totally helpful as I can't remember exactly what dish it was...\n\nTheir gelato is pretty delish, and the boys serving it are always sweet and helpful - and fast.\n\nTheir outdoor seating is a huge plus for me as it allows me to people watch all the new faces coming into Culver City now that it's the place to be. And yes, they have heat lamps for us whiners.\n\nAnyway, I love this place. Good food, good atmosphere, and friendly waitstaff. What more could you want?",

I prefer their fettuccine diavolo, spicy red sauce with grilled shrimp.  My boyfriend typically gets a pizza or pesto gnocchi.  Service is alright, sometimes i feel that the waitresses are faking the Italian accents and are really from Finland.  The outdoor seating is lovely for a Friday night date.\n\nYou can purchase a bottle next door at the wine bar and bring it over for dinner.

This time I got to try their food and it was surprisingly good. Started off with an appetizer of their meatballs and it was super filling. Comes with three of them and I suggest if she likes it, to give her the third one LOL! I recommend that everyone try this dish, it's a good choice. For my entree, I ordered exactly what I was in the mood for, which was the seafood pasta. The portion was a perfect size - although took longer than expected for it to come out. The pasta itself was well done - wasn't extremely memorable but filled me up nicely. It doesn't matter though - that nutella gelato for dessert was just so good. I tried the tiramisu gelato and actually the nutella flavor tasted more like the traditional tiramisu flavor that I expected than the tiramisu gelato did haha. All in all, a satisfying meal from start to finish.\n\nFood: 4 stars --- Service: 3 stars --- Atmosphere: 3.5 stars --- Price(value): 4 stars",

The food was quite good, and the location is conveniently situated near ample parking, but for the amount of money we spent that evening - I would have expected much better customer service. Once seated, we had to ask for water four times before it was brought out (20 minutes after sitting down). The waiter seemed impatient while taking our order (some of our guests were elderly, and hard of hearing - but this is little reason to be rude or harried), and after we ordered appetizers, they brought a partial order out. When I inquired why only a few dishes had arrived, they told me that they were out of the others, and that someone should have informed us of that (yet, no one did). They offered to take one of the dishes off of the bill, which was nce, but it didn't solve the issue of a hungry table of people that assumed more food was coming - it would have been appropriate to come by and offer to sub something else for the item that was out. When we were ending our meal, another waiter came over to inform us they were \"closing in 5 minutes, so we need to be done by then.\" We agreed to pay the bill as quickly as possible to help expedite their closing process, but the servers seemed unhappy with that - and proceeded to clear all of our glasses before some of us were done with our wine. This was the most frustrating behavior of the entire evening - and I was embarrassed that my clients had this experience. I understand that nobody likes to be an inconvenience to a service staff, but we were NOT the only people in the restaurant, and were very sensitive to arriving on time and placing our orders quickly. To be rushed out of the restaurant when we had already paid our bill and left a 20% tip (despite the lousy service), seemed completely unwarranted. I would not return for a business meal.",

After a refreshing healthy dinner at Tender Greens, we went over to Ugo for some dessert and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the bar resembled many of the bars in Italy.  I was immediately taken by the array of flavors available.  They had a lot more than the traditional espresso, hazelnut, tiramasu and such that you usually find.  I opted for a small and got half terrone (nougat) and half Amaretto.  I really liked the texture, creaminess and all thing associated with gelato, but I was a little disappointed in the flavors.  The terrone was just sweet nothing and the amaretto was not almondy enough.  However, it didn't stop me from finishing my entire dish! I would go back again, but I'll give the other flavors a try.",

                  "review": "On a whim, the bf and I decided that on date night, we wanted to eat outside.  Also, I have an obsession with frosty treats like gelato.  Thus, we end up at Ugo.\n\nGood things first:\nThe outdoor seating is nice, good view of downtown and people watching, nice little lamps when it gets dark.  The tables are not on top of each other so it's pretty comfortable.  The bread was awesome, and the staff was very attentive in general.  We got 2 rounds of the bread, which is out of the ordinary.  Water always filled and wine was good.\n\nThe food:\nWe had the Insalata Mediterraneo.  This was tasty, although a little heavy on the kalamata olives and a little light on the tomatoes.  BF and I split a special - the Fettucine Al Mare.  Now, I'm pretty hard on Italian food, I know what I like and I know how I like it cooked (blame Nonna).  I thought the sauce was tasty, but not an arrabiata, as advertised.  It didn't have a lot of kick.  Also, the fettucine itself was a bit overcooked and stuck together.  Shrimp, clams and scallops were juicy and plump, but the calamari was a little chewy.  Lastly, we got a side of polpette.  The menu says the polpette are 2 big meatballs.  We got 4 little meatballs in a whole lotta overly sweet and boring tomato sauce.  We debated whether they'd run out of homemade polpette and substituted pre-made frozen ones.  \n\nBad things:\nFor dessert, we ordered Gelato Affogato.  This is basically a scoop of gelato with a shot of espresso poured over it.  When I ordered it, the waitress told me that it was served with vanilla gelato, which I don't like, so I asked her to sub hazelnut.  I was told that they don't do that, but she'd check.  Now, I'm not usually demanding, but they have a gelato bar...so what does it matter which flavor we scoop.  Especially given that the espresso comes on the side, and you can order plain dishes of gelato.  The real beef was that she brought back a vanilla gelato and told me \"they just don't do that\" when I asked where the hazelnut was.  I told her I'd prefer not to have the vanilla.  About 5 minutes later, she brought back hazelnut and told me \"they just forgot\".  It seems silly, but I love my frosty treats, and it seemed like she just didn't want to go to the trouble of returning it, banking on me just having the vanilla.  That being said, they had a really nice selection of gelato desserts and the hazelnut was very tasty.\n\nAnyway, overall service was good, atmosphere was nice and the food was...ok.  I might go back for the whole experience, but I don't know that I'd go back for anything involving the red sauce.",

Like other Yelp*ers have noted, the menu has changed for the worse and the prices have increased significantly. 3/4 of the pizza toppings have disappeared, the pizza we did order wasn't cooked right, and even the sauteed vegetables aren't as tasty as they once were. There are, however, a few things that haven't changed. The staff is still very friendly and attentive, and the bread is still very good. And when you're sitting on the patio on the Cardiff side, the familiar scent of sewage permeates the air. I had been dining at the restaurant at least once a month before the remodel, and the cafe nearly as often, but  the new Ugo doesn't have the same appeal. Time to find another Italian restaurant within walking distance of downtown CC.",

The bottomless drinks were a little pricey ($20!) but we decided to try it out anyways.\n\nWe got there at around 12:00, and the bottomless drinks only went until 1, so we knew we had to hurry in order to get our moneys worth. The waitresses are a little hard to flag down for refills, so if they're walking around by your table make sure to ask them then.\n\nFor food I ordered the chicken pesto panini, and it came out relatively quickly. The sandwich was good, and it with a good side salad. Unfortunately, after guzzling many mimosas and bellinis I wasn't very full, and left most of my sandwich untouched.\n\nHowever, when the waitress came around, she accidentally knocked over my bellini onto my sandwich and all over my dress. Normally if something like this happened i would be mentally knocking off stars in my head for my yelp review. However, the waitress was so nice and apologetic, that I really didn't mind being soaked in bellini. She brought me out a new sandwich, offered us free gelato, and extended the bottomless drinks until 2:00 (score!).\n\nThe gelato was excellent, the drinks were good, and the service was impeccable. Although a little pricier than my normal brunch price range, I'll definitely be down to come back to Ugo on a weekend to enjoy a nice meal with friends.",

(I know, there are only 5, but I'm trying to make a point here!)\n\nI've stopped in here before to have a Peroni before meeting friends for dinner at other places in downtown Culver City (shame on me!) Had dinner here on Friday night with a new friend (Shout-out to Barbara) and had a great time! We met at Bottle Rock for a glass of wine and might have stayed to eat but the waitstaff seemed to be having issues and to be honest the menu was kind of blah, but that's for another review...While waiting for our table at Ugo, we were admiring the desert case full of goodies! The Tiramisu really caught my eye. While walking to our table, one of the waiters told me that that was the last 2 of the Tiramisu (hey that rhymes!) and that he would put them aside if  we thought that we would want them. We opted for saving one of them and were effusive in our thanks for the thoughtfulness (he wasn't even our waiter!) So we ordered our dinners, a traditional style lasagna and a small pizza with buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and basil (and of course more wine!) Food was brought out quickly and was fresh and warm. It was all very good, nothing particularly noteworthy, just really good and tasty. Now here comes the fun part! Our waiter shows up looking down at the ground and shuffling his feet (not a good sign!) He tell us the awful detail of how someone has absconded with out Tiramisu and how sorry he was that it had happened. We feigned shock and disappointment and laughed with him, telling him it was no big deal. Everyone had been so nice and the food so good, a missed desert was not going to spoil anything. While we talked after dinner, another waiter came to our table with a desert plate. He began a little speech about how they felt so bad about the \"missing-misu\" and that we had been so nice about it that they put together an \"off-the-menu\" desert (we'll call it \"faux-misu\") with cookies too! Way cool! When we got our bill to leave, the waiter thanked us again for being so understanding and that he has had experiences in the past where customers were less than kind about being \"snubbed\". Shame on those customers! Loved the food and loved the crew..so there you go Ugo!",

My husband and I use to come here all the time when we lived in PDR but unfortunately we moved further away :( It's definitely a super casual, down-home place with good food, an awesome owner and it's very affordable.\n\nMy mother is from Burma, now Myanmar, so I grew up eating samusa, mohinga (fish soup) and ono causwe (chicken noodle coconut soup). Their samusa is a bit different from the one I'm used to but I like it anyway. The mohinga and ono causwe are pretty good and it's nice to know I can get these dishes on the west side.\n\nI love that they have the dessert that has cream of wheat in it. I don't know what it's called but it's kind of like a not too sweet bread pudding but instead of bread you use cream of wheat? I don't know how else to describe it. It's best warm and reminds me of the one my great grandma used to make.\n\nThe owner is SO NICE! He always checks on you and wants to make sure you're happy. This time he gave my friend and I some cups of chai after our meal which was really good.\n\nSadly there aren't too many restaurants in LA that have Burmese food so I'm really glad Jasmine Market has some Burmese dishes when I am not in the Bay Area. Love this place and wish that I could come more often!!!\n\nIf you ever go to SF, go to Mandalay on California St. There's usually a wait so don't go super hangry but it is more comfortable than Burma Superstar (where you're practically sitting with the people next to you since the tables are so close together). The owners are also really nice though my mom went to high school with the woman so maybe they're extra nice to us ;)\nCream of Wheat Dessert - like my great grandma's!!!",

This one was one of the most recommended but I personally didn't think it was THAT good. It's not bad though!\n\nFirst off I think it's dd that they close at 4PM everyday which makes it so difficult to get to! When I got here they were sold out of the original glazed which I consider to be the best way to judge a donut place.\n\nI went with the buttermilk bar and the cinnamon butterfly. They were both good but not blow-your-mind good. The buttermilk bar was soft and ever so slightly \" tart \" from\nThe buttermilk. Very nice! The cinnamon butterfly tastes like a cinnamon roll donut. They are both very indulgent and very sweet!\n\nI still haven't tried the original glazed so might have to update the review if I do.\n\nIf you're in the area, try it out. But don't go out of your way during LA traffic time to get them.\nCinnamon butterfly\nButtermilk bar",

They had a door person who was waving people in when it was your turn. She did make it hard to get out as she was in the way but that's okay. The workers were nice and we got a dozen donuts. If you buy all \"cake donuts\" I believe a dozen is $19. We got a mixed bunch so ours was considered \"fancy\" at $21. All the donuts were good and fresh! It obviously felt unhealthy cause donuts just are! We were lucky the butter milk one had just came out of the oven so it was hot!  I ate it about 30 mins later when it was still warm and it was good! The glaze was so soft too. Blueberry was okay as well. Crumb was okay. I also got a cinnamon bun which was tasty on day 2! They didn't have guava when I went so that was unfortunate. They take credit card which is great and there's parking in the lot next door. Don't try to park at a spot designated for a different business... the parking attendant will call you out!\nFancy box $21; Instagram @myfaerieland\nStore front",

You almost forget about finding the jelly payoff after losing yourself in her fluffy, perfectly-sweet enclosure - which means you don't mind so much that the jelly itself proves challenging to locate. This elusiveness only adds to her intrigue and your anticipation. Once excavated, she presents like a precious treasure, a trove of sugary (raspberry?) jam, nothing like that artificial gel-like bs that keeps most non-East-coasters ignorant to the bliss that is a true jelly donut.\nSo far I rank this jelly donut #1 or #2, perhaps after that hyped but deserving Eastern franchise that stole my heart at an early age and fills me with nostalgic joy, even after losing something on her overland journey.\nThe proximity to other top-in-class donuts such as the cakey vanilla coconut or soft custard adds to Primo's allure. I can't tell if this drip coffee is crap or perfection, but it goes very well with delicious donuts.",

A lot of our guests commented on how colorful, fun and good the donuts were, definitely a fun twist to a traditional wedding. We've run into the owner Ralph a couple times during wedding planning and after the wedding, and he's always been friendly to the customers coming in (there's always a steady flow of people on a Saturday morning).\n\nIf you're considering them for catering for an event, go for it!

Perfect amount of sweetness, Cake-ness, and a crunch at the bite. It is a bit thick, so the donut best compliments with black coffee. The blue berry donut wasn't a big hit. It was a bit too sweet and tasted artificial. But the customer service was very sweet and they all had smiles on their faces. :)",

You can pretty much walk into any of them and know that you're going to come out happy and satisfied. But that wasn't the case here.\n\nI came in at about 9:30am on a Saturday for a maple bar and... a chocolate bar? Is that what it's called? The raised donut bar that has a chocolatey frosting on it. Anyways, the two donuts were cold and stale almost like they were a day old. The chocolate really wasn't very good and the maple wasn't as strong as I like it. Texture isn't something I'm super particular about but the fact that these were stale made it more obvious that these weren't uber fluffy.\n\nCome on guys, I don't want old donuts that early in the morning. There are plenty of better donut options on the west side - I won't be coming back.\nChocolate bar and maple bar... stale!",

When I ordered a dozen of their baked cinnamon rolls, I also explained it was for my husband, and how excited we were to be visiting their bakery.\n\nWhen I got to the bakery by the scheduled pickup hour, Ralph Primo Jr came out from the back to greet me! He thanked me for my order, and also explained that they had read my note, and because my husband loved cinnamon rolls so much his father came out to bake the batch himself!\n\nWe are so grateful, and the experience of enjoying our cinnamon rolls were made special and heartwarming. Not to mention, the rolls were delicious! They were the perfect balance between cinnamon taste and frosting.

And you should too.\n\nThe donuts are fresh and delicious and there are plenty to choose from. Every one I've tried has been great. But you really do have to try the buttermilk bar. Get a dozen of the others if you like but get yourself a buttermilk bar.\n\nThere is another reason I love this place. The fantastic donuts are still made and sold fresh daily by the same couple that bought the place in 1956. They love what they do and it shows. You get that small town, friendly feeling when you walk in and are greeted by Celia or some other member of the family. And you can look back into the kitchen and see him making the donuts. I think this, along with the great tasting donuts, is why they've been named one of the best donuts shops in America.\n\nCan you taste nostalgia? Yes. Absolutely!\n\nIn. Every. Single. Donut.",

But if you're looking for a gorgeous, deep-fried slab of sourdough dipped in sugar to wash down with cold milk, this is where you go. Coffee is bad though. One star off for that.\n\nTwo things to know... one: come in the morning, earlier the better. The difference between a hot, fresh glazed sourdough and a cold, sitting-under-glass one is substantial; in fact, if you can't eat one right out of fryer, you're really missing out on the whole reason to introduce that much sugar and fat into your body. And two: go for the hang. There are always some old-timers spinning yarns.",

I read the other reviews here & decided to check it out this morning.  I'm not really a donut person as for far too many years my experience with them has not been good- always stale. Now I've found the place that reminds me of the donuts from my childhood- fresh, melt-in-your- mouth deliciousness!!!!  I only like raised donuts so got a couple maple glazed long johns & glazed donuts. Holy crap, they were still warm in the center & I was in heaven. My husband prefers cake donuts & had the same experience with his chocolate frosted ones.  We went at about 11am (Saturday) & had no issues with parking in their lot & it wasn't crowded. Service was extremely friendly.  This is a definite place for repeat business!!!!",

The buttermilk bars from Primo's Donuts are the best thing that has ever happened to me (yes, I'll probably say this on my wedding day). They're shaped like mini-pound cakes, with a good weight to them, and covered with tears from angels in heaven (kidding, it's sugar). The insides are unmistakibly donut-y, but with a more cake-like texture toward the center. They're hefty enough to remind you of the toll on your waistline, but still fluffy enough for you to really cram them into your mouth on your way to buy elastic-waist jeans. You can really taste the buttermilk (and smell it - yes, I lift these donuts to my nose and smell them before I bite in), and it provides just the slightest tang and a more complex flavor to complement the donut. I'm pretty sweet averse, and the buttermilk prevents these from being too sweet. They are SO CHEAP and really consistent - in my many weeks (yes.. weeks) of eating these, they've always tasted like they just fell from heaven. Sometimes I stick them in the microwave for 15-20 seconds if they've been sitting out for a while, and they taste even better when they're warmer and softer.\nI've also had the cinnamon twists (pretty good, but the cinnamon taste is kind of weird when paired with the donut taste), the regular twist (better than the cinnamon twist!), the cinnamon crunch (delicious, but the grease tastes a bit weird when you heat these up), and the jelly donut (nice and substantial - the donut doesn't collapse when you bite in. And the raspberry tastes like raspberry!). But the buttermilk bars are my soul mate.",

Grandma was in there behind the counter and several happy guys reading the help wanted ads.  I got back in the car and despite my no eating while driving in a strange place rule, had to have a big bite and OMG, buttery melt in my mouth delirium.  It did not make it past Pico and Westwood on my reverse drive.\nThe bag was heavy with just 2 in there and after dinner tonight, I had to have a bite of the crumb just for a late night pleasure, and it was.  \nThanks to that Primo family for making my day...

The owners are always nice and pleasant and they really seem to care about their customers.  The donuts were really good but the maple bars were a little too heavy for me.  Their regular and glazed donuts are awesome.  If you are in the neighborhood, check them out!",

It's not the best atmosphere - but who cares with donuts like these!  I do love the hand-painted lettering on the glass and the sweet people that work there - Mrs. Primo herself helped us - and you've gotta love anyone who's dedicated herself to the art of donuts for 50 years. The donuts struck the right balance in both density and sweetness - unlike Krispy Kreme or other chains. Worth the trip!",

Both were alright and satisfied my cravings.\n\nBeef pho: $15 for ordering online for pick up. The price is reasonable for the west side so no complaints. The pho was packaged very well with the broth in a large container and the noodles and beef packaged in a smaller container that nests on top. Very cool but also lots of plastic waste. The broth was decent but lacked depth of flavor. The noodle and meat portion was generous, though!\n\nImperial Pork Rolls: $9 online price. These are deep fried rolls packed with meat and served with fish sauce. The rolls were kind of greasy but it's a fried roll so I'm not sure why I was surprised. There was also a ton of meat packed into each roll but it was a little dry.\n\nOverall, I don't regret trying this place but it could have been better. I'll probably come here again since it's nearby.",

Especially if I'm paying some hefty price tags on it. Foods had very minimum to no flavors and that's included their Thai tea and boba drink. All tasted like water. Chickens and pork was over cooked. Banh mi was decent, thanks to the sauce. Presentation was the only thing they got going for. For any restaurants out there. If you can't cook, please don't open a restaurant just for money. I'm tired of eating out just for the service and lack of flavors. I've never been so disappointed. So bad, I didn't even want to take a picture of anything.

In my edit I put the link to that review, but I guess it violated the Yelp terms of service and my review was subsequently removed.\n\nMy friends and family can all attest to the fact that I regularly eat extremely bland foods (eg. salad with no dressing) and almost always get dehydrated when eating out. Having said that, the broth was beyond bland and seemed liked it was separated into two layers even after mixing - almost as if flavor was just mixed in or something. The spring rolls tasted fine. Yelp's 2 star says, \"Could've been better\" and that's exactly how I felt about my food from Phorage.",

I ended up getting their Jidori Chicken Broken Rice Bowl, Pho Birria de Res, and a Thai Tea Boba.\n\nThe Jidori Chicken Broken Rice Bowl was simple and had a good amount of chicken with rice and some veggies on the side paired with a sweet fish sauce. It was simple, but tasty and straightforward. I kinda wished that it had some more herbs and veggies to lighten the overall meal.\n\nThe Pho Birria de Res was very interesting since it is a fusion between the Mexican stewed broth with Vietnamese pho. I really like the concept, but the broth itself was a bit lacking in flavor and was missing depth. The rice noodles that it came with were a bit too clumped up together as well and took a bit of reheating to get it to separate. The veggies that it came with was shredded cabbage and jalape\u00f1os with plenty of limes to brighten the dish. It's an intriguing dish, but can be executed better.\n\nThe Thai Tea Boba was decent. The tapioca pearls were a little bit tough, but not too bad. Not the best boba that I have had, but alright.\n\nHopefully when they are able to open back up for dine-in the quality will improve.\nSee all photos from Sky T. for Phorage",

Due to the covid weight i've already gained, i usually only allow myself to eat one, which comes with the Bun, so it works out.\n\nThe pork Bun is delicious, but if you're in the mood for something that feels a little healthier, order the chicken Bun which is so delicious. I'm not a huge pho lover so i'll spare you my review, i do know anything they make with oxtail is super good IMO.\n\nTikifish (poke) is operating out of phorage during covid, i am guilty of ordering Bun and poke in one visit.\n\nLove this little Vietnamese joint, and hope they make it through the pandemic, staff is awesome. if you're driving, there's a convenient lot to park and pick up.\nchicken Bun with fried Imperial Roll",

The beef was not good quality even though it claims to be \"high quality wagyu\" and the noodles were undercooked. and the soup. THE SOUP HAD NO FLAVOR AT ALL. It honestly tasted like water with  a hint of beef flavor. In one of our pho bowls, there was a long piece of plastic.\nThe spring rolls wrapping was so thick and very hard to chew.\nThe rice and pork bowls were so small and so were the wings. Definitely not worth the money.\nWould not recommend this place to anyone.",

I ordered the pork bahn mi this time And the pieces of pork were so chewy, cold and at one point, just a slab of pork belly that was so difficult to bite into to. I also ordered the spring roll where they cut into 3 pieces so that trying to eat the middle pieces ended up spilling everywhere when trying to unstick it from the other roll. Overall really sloppy and expensive which i guess you pay for on the westside.\nFresh Spring Roll",

I was pleasantly surprised as i did not expect that much since one of the review said she only got one piece of oxtail. The soup broth itself is ok. I did not detect the anise that usually in a bowl of ph. So it it is an average bowl of pho in term of condiment, slightly disappointed in the smell department , on the other hand very generous portion of oxtail. So 3 points for oxtail pho. I also had spring role. Again average. I was wondering if the owner is Korean or Vietnamese or Indian considering what is on the menu and how they are cooked. The Korean looking waitresses were very polite . I did not have to wait for too long for anything.  Parking however is a challenge! You are lucky to find an open space for parking. I parked 2 blocks down the street and walk to the restaurant. I did not mind walking as LA parking is tough and scarce any where. Overall, i feel that the food s are good enough for me to be back here and order some other dishes, but not for the same pho\nSeating inside restaurant",

On our most recent visit the food took longer than expected given that we were one of two customers in the joint. Then at the bottom of the bok choi was a large cooked and marinated bug.  No one who worked there was sure what to do. They offered to make us more bug filled bok choi but we opted to have the bok choi refunded. That was the least they could do. I do think they should've comped the whole meal but I guess that was too much to ask for eating insects. We won't be back.\n\nUpdate: The manager contacted me and gave a full refund so no hard feelings but eating bugs is still unappetizing.\nDead bug in the bok choi. No thank you.\nUseful 8\nFunny\nCool\n5/24/2014Previous review\nThe chicken pho from here was among the best I've ever tasted.  The chicken strips were delicious and the spices were terrific.  The chicken banh mi, however, didn't really rank that highly even though the bread itself was great.  I think it was the texture of the chicken that didn't really do it for me.  ",

The soup could have used a few more hours to cook to really get that beef flavor. Also you don't get very much meat compared to the many pho restaurants all across LA.\n\nImperial Roll ($7) - Not bad. The egg rolls were crispy, but there was too much fried batter. At times, it felt like I took big bites of batter and no pork.\n\nThey tried to make a modern version of Vietnamese food and it doesn't work. It doesn't feel authentic and it is far more expensive than what I am use to.

My friend suggested that I order the Jidori Chickan and Waffles, which wasn't on the menu but is something that they offer on sunday lunch. I AM SO GLAD I DID BECAUSE IT WAS THE BOMB!!\n\nThe chicken was moist and juicy and the batter had the perfect crunch to it. The waffle had a great waffle-ly consistancy and did not taste super cakey like some waffles do. It was paired with a hash brown similar to what you would get a mcdonalds as well as a side of ketchup and coconut maple syrup. SO DELICIOUS\n\nI also ordered the imperial rolls.. OMG I COULD PLOW THROUGH 4 ORDERS OF THESE THEY WERE SO GOOD. Sadly for like 7-8 dollars you only get 2 rolls. # what\n\nWould definitely come back next time to try the pho and other rice dishes. I had a little bit of the lemongrass chicken wings which were delicious and perfectly cooked as well.\nHave you ever seen anything so beautiful in your entire life ??? jidori chicken and waffles; off menu item available Sundays, yw",

There are about 10 or so parking spaces shared by several businesses but we were lucky to find a spot on a Monday night around 8pm.\n\nYou order at the front, take a number and they bring the food to you. They have a big communal table in the middle of the restaurant and 3 tables on the side. We ordered the Oxtail Pho and the Jidori Chicken Clay Pot, both of which were very flavorful and the portions were generous (despite being a tad pricey).\n\nThe server and cashier were very friendly but service was a little spotty at times (rice forgotten to be brought out, and forgotten again).

Upon entering, you order with the cashier and are then free to sit wherever you'd like.  It can get crowded during the dinner rush, especially on a rainy day, but I've never had to wait for a table to open.\n\nConsidering it's not a full service restaurant, the service is also great. The staff is quick to bring water to your table (which I prefer over the self-served mint water), service is relatively quick, and they'll even box it up for you (particularly helpful for soup dishes).  I've never had a bad experience with any of the workers, and everyone I've interacted with is really pleasant.  \n\nThe only negative is that the parking lot is rather small.  However, cars are usually coming in and out quickly, so I've never had to wait more than a couple minutes for a spot.",

However, tonight after driving for 15 min just for the old memories here, I accidentally got a bowl of trash. Everybody knows that the soup is the essence of Phos, and this restaurant did use to make the soup with amazingly fruitful and various flavors. But what I received tonight was basicly mixture of onions, noodles, and soup which is as light as spring water, even tastes like bleach in it. I was really disappointed and regarded this as a very disrespectful meal. Although the time I walked in was 9pm and I know you have a lot to finish before closing, you are NOT SUPPOSED to serve food in such quality.

The chicken isn't crispy if you're wondering. It comes with vegetables so I wrapped my chicken in the lettuce with the veggies and hot sauce. A bit more work but worth it.",

Beef pho was ok, broth was decently rich and it came with all the typical side garnishes that were pretty fresh.\n\nHowever, the chicken pho was maybe a little too natural/healthy as the broth tasted so bland I had to add almost an entire bottle of hoisin sauce and siracha to make it anywhere tasty enough to eat. Definitely don't recommend this and wouldn't get it again if I went back. Not sure if it was just my bowl or if it's always like that, but it needed a lot of salt and flavor!\n\nEnvironment itself was nice though and I guess what you pay for. Very hipster :)",

                  "review": "Surprisingly, Phorage offers pretty tasty Vietnamese food at West LA prices.  There is one caveat, it takes forever for the food to arrive!!\n\nThe first time I came here, we ordered imperial rolls as an appetizer.  It cost about $7 which is very pricey in my opinion and came out in 5 minutes after ordering. It came with two small egg rolls. We ordered a bowl of pho as our main course that was about $9.  It took 20 minutes for our bowl of pho to arrive! Honestly, that is longest time I have ever waited for a bowl of pho. The pho is pretty tasty and the portion size was great!  However, the veggies that it came with were a bit on the skimpy side.\n\nSecond time around, I got my pho within 5 minutes. Yay! However, my husbands' dish did not come out until 20 minutes later! In fact, I was finished with my dish before his came and I'm a slow eater.\n\nThese inconsistencies are a bit annoying and I really hope that Phorage works these kinks out as it is becoming a common theme among these reviews.",

Five months later, I decided to give it another try- being asian and having pregnant lady pho cravings, I decided to get the oxtail pho. It was the best decision I made since adopting my dog. I was surprised by how good the broth tasted and how tender the oxtail meat was.\n\nI'm now a happy regular customer who recommends it to everyone I know. Thanks Phorage for curing my Asian soup cravings. You're one of the reasons I smile everyday.\nBest oxtail pho in LA!",

Washugyu Beef and Free Range Chicken are  $9 , while oxtail is $11. With either selection you get the noodles,  protein, broth, and the plate of fresh bean sprouts, peppers, and thai basil. You can add rice, noodles, veggies, tofu, or an egg for a $1 each. ( I love adding tripe and the other bits, but this isn't really the place for chewy & fatty \"lesser quality\" meats [sad face] )\n\nThe Broth\nIt has body and mild flavor, but it is light on the salt and fat. If you like your pho plain and rich this might be a problem. However, If you dose your Pho with Sriracha, peppers, and thai basil, this shouldn't really matter for you.\n\nThe ingredients\nThe beef is very good. It was tender and flavorful, and a cut above the typical meat that you get at your local pho #1-100. You get a good proportion of meat.  The noodles are pretty standard, so they don't take away or give anything new to the dish.\n\nThe Pho: Good or Bad?\nUltimately your enjoyment of this bowl will depend on what you like about Pho.  If you appreciate locally sourced food and modern re-tellings of comfort food, Phorage will work for you. The meat is the shinning part of this dish. However, if you are looking for something more traditional (fatty rich broth + chewy meats)  you won't be satisfied, but you should have known that walking in.\n\nstray observations\n1) The set up is no different from Chego which used to be there. A big shared raised table with a counter on one side and small 4 top tables on the other.\n\n2) If you are feeling particular rushed you can order from your phone using an app and it will be there super quick.\nFor those who want to order in a hurry!\nmenu",

It's a shame that there isn't a single good pho place in the area, but I will keep searching and I will not be back here.

I understand the people giving lower ratings because of the small location size, the limited parking, and the occasional wait time, but the flavor and quality of food is off-the-charts / mind blowing / making me hungry right now / worth the wait!\n\nI grew up in a primarily Asian neighborhood where Pho options were endless and amazing.  Then I moved to Los Angeles and found that the Pho places in LA could never compare to what I could get at home...UNTIL I CAME TO PHORAGE!!  \n\nI talked to one of the owners/managers(?) and he explained the 12+ hours of cooking time that goes into each delicious bowl.  Then he let me sample some of their watermelon green iced tea which was very refreshing.\n\nTip: Go during non-peak hours.\n\nOrder:\n-Washugyu Beef Pho\n-Imperial Rolls\n-Jidori Chicken Broken Rice Plate\n\nShared the three items with my wife and we were more than content :)",

The broth seemed salty and darker in color as compared to other pho broths. The noodles also seemed overcooked. The one good thing about the beef pho was the amount of beef in the soup.\n\nIn addition to the beef pho, we also ordered the crispy vegetable imperial rolls. The rolls are meant to be wrapped in lettuce, which are brought out with the rolls and sauce.  The rolls were really good - great flavor, great texture.\n\nI think we'll give the place another try. I want to try their pork vermicelli noodles. As for the pho, you can find much better pho in LA.",

There're lots of reasons I love this place - the ambience, cleanliness and the chill tunes they play all day. But most of all,  of course, it's the quality pho they make. One big problem I have with some OTHER pho places is the meat, whose quality (and sometimes origin) can sometimes be questionable at best. But PHORAGE always uses 100% wagyu beef, and it tastes great. The broth is always dark and richly flavorful, and the bowls are big and hearty. Their Oxtail pho is out of this world, slow cooked for 30 hours before it hits your taste buds with its full flavored goodness. Can't say enough positive things about the place. They also have some of the best Thai iced tea I've ever had!\n\nTry it. You won't be disappointed!",

I probably came here once a month and tried different things including the beef pho, chicken vermicilli, spring rolls, broken rice plate, and also the chicken bahn mi. I'm not exactly sure what happened, but something about the quality of food started to diminish. The amount of meat started to get smaller, broth started to taste bland and there was some inconsistency that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Regardless, I think it's a cool place worth checking out.",

Upon unpacking our meal we discovered the jidori chicken we ordered was incredibly cold, when I say cold I mean refrigerated. It felt like they had taken someone else's meal from earlier in the day and thrown it in a plastic bag. I ordered chicken pho and asked for extra vegetables and noodles which they did not provide. I called up and spoke to the manager Alan and he was\nIncredibly rude and unsympathetic. All I was looking for was either a discount or a refund for NOT providing me what I ordered. Alan was very rude and abrupt and hung up on me twice. Honestly I am beside myself, their food is mediocre at best but their manager Alan is really lacking at social skills. I wouldn't go back there for anything. Their pho is way too salty and their food is below par. Go to pho show down the street. Alan is an absolute a$$, and should not be working in customer service, he ruined the experience.\nUseful 2\nFunny 1\nCool\nEric C.\nBusiness Owner",

Phorage was an accidental stop. We saw it in a small shopping center and thought why not. Believe me, I expected to be disappointed. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I had the Oxtail Soup and was surprised not only with the quality of food but how generous their portions are. The presentation is clean and looks amazing and drinks are served in glass mason jars. (Megan noted that and said it was her favorite). The place it's seating area is on the cozier side, luckily we went at a slower time, I do think I'd like to be there if it was jam packed. There is a ling bar down the middle of the room and table around the walls. I can see myself being a little cloister phobic in there. But i don't mind, that pho was delicious.",

Fresh ingredients or not, more time can be saved in prep, so I don't buy this reasoning of slow service due to fresh ingredients. There's always a fine balance between adequate staffing and timely orders. No one should have to wait 20-30 mins for a meal. You can increase rating by offering a snack or something people can try- plantains or something costs pennies to make let's be real.\n\nValue- not there. Overpriced, not for the food/experience, but for the quality. If I can make it better, more fresh with savory flavor profiles at home, I don't feel I'm getting value. Seriously. What I pay for when I go out, especially with friends, is the experience of having someone who can prepare an amazing dish, their time and dedication to their craft- not just turning out plates. I felt as though there was no love in our dishes. When I brought it up I got \"we've never had a complaint\", but they were friendly about it, just made me feel like I was in the wrong for saying anything. I'll go back, I like to give the benefit of the doubt, but I'll ask for more flavor and heat. I need to feel satisfied when I leave,  and the taste lingering in my mouth from my first experience just reminds me of dry chicken with little flavor or heat but well presented.\nMy search for LAs most amazing Jamaican continues.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nDerrick A.\nBusiness Manager\n11/22/2018\nHenry, we're disappointed that you didn't get the service and meal that we pride ourselves on. While it's true that many of our dishes take longer due to preparation (and that prepping certain items ahead of time would save time but would also limit freshness), you should absolutely be seeing the love in that preparation when your dish arrives. We're always willing to add more spice to or modify any order, and we hope we can make you something on your next visit that you'll truly love.\n",

The owner and founder of Janga, Derrick Angus, is a native Jamaican, and we assure you our recipes are authentic.

The husband and I were in downtown last night for the spiked lemonade event (yum!) and we stopped in for dinner.\n\nWe ordered the janga plate (aka shrimp) with kale and rice and beans ($18). The shrimp was so yummy. It was very spicy though so it's not for the faint of heart (though we're pretty weak when it comes to spicy foods). The onions and bell peppers with the shrimp were really flavorful too! The beans and rice were alright. Nothing special. I saw that one of the highlights for this place is the kale and I saw it and was a little confused. The kale didn't seem like anything special until I tasted it. It was surprisingly delicious! I know kale is all the rage and I've sort of just been tolerating it. However if all the kale tasted like the kale at janga, I would love to eat kale everyday!\n\nPrice point is a little high. Service was lacking a bit. I felt bad for our waitress though. She was the only one working and she was slammed. Perhaps someone had called in sick.\n\nAnyway, cool place to check out. From what I heard this place is great for brunch.

Kale was steamed and lightly seasoned with a slight buttery flavor.  The pineapple ginger juice was great too--sweet and spicy. Ambience is casual. They have a cute patio with seating as well as indoor seating and bar seating. Would have loved to try the fish over grits, but that is a sat/sun brunch special.  I was told the is live music on Fridays. Happy hour is 4-7 and I happened to go on a Tuesday nt and they had a taco tue special,  but I didn't see any tacos on the menu.

We ordered 2 different chicken dishes that both were \"jerk\" but they came with different, equally bad flavors. I splurged and got the jerk chicken and fried shrimp and it was barely worth $19.99. I got 4 measly pieces of shrimp and it was the only decent part of the meal. The wings were worst of all! They tasted frozen and were completely dried out, cold and over cooked. The service was also lacking where we had to chase down different waitresses to pay the bill. Not once did the waitress ask how the food was. I didn't even see our initial waitress again before we left the restaurant. We should have complained but didn't want to make a scene in front of our friends. I should also mention, we were all half way through our meal by the time my husband's plate arrived. Definitely not worth $80.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nDerrick A.\nBusiness Manager\n11/17/2018\nAlissa, we're very disappointed that we couldn't find you more to enjoy. Our portions and prices reflect the very high quality of our ingredients, but that should be something that comes through in the final meal.

They have a bar also which is something hole in the wall Caribbean joints don't offer. So definitely come to the place for a craft cocktail & the ambiance. But if you're looking for the Caribbean cuisine you had when on vacation in Jamaica then you will be disappointed. However Derrick. (Owner) offers steamed kale which is his specialty & it's delicious. His beans & rice is off a lil in comparison to the other beans & rice I've had at some of my fav Caribbean joints. I've had the jerk chicken which to me is overpriced for the portion & just not the best but it's delicious if that makes since. When I think of authentic jerk chicken I think of very spicy flavorful bone in chicken. He serves his jerk chicken boneless & his jerk sauce has flavor but it is sweet and very mild so if you aren't the type that likes spicy food you may actually enjoy this. But for me this was disappointing. I've tried the curry chicken which was pretty good I ordered it extra spicy. They also have cheap jerk chicken & fish tacos which are pretty good. The bartender Chris is very serious & a lil uptight but he knows his stuff when it comes to bartending.\nUseful 3\nFunny\nCool\nDerrick A.\nBusiness Manager\n10/31/2016\nWe're disappointed to hear we didn't leave a stronger impression on you, Mollie!

                  "review": "It's rare that I give 5 stars, but I really had no choice but to.  Everything about this experience was perrrfect. Our first visit.\nThere were maybe 1 or 2 people seated inside and the front outside patio was completely available so there we sat.  We missed any direct sunlight (3:30 ish), but that's okay because I was dressed for shade anyway.  I never went inside but the restaurant was nicely styled with an airey open clean feel.  This gave the impression that the restroom, should I have had to use it, would have been equally impressive.  Which is a +, because the upkeep of a restroom for me actually dictates whether I would come back or not.  So for now, the impression speaks for itself.\nAs for our meal. My roomie had the blackened tilapia with kale and roasted potatoes, I had the oxtail with red beans/rice and kale and my BFF who always eats for two, yes I said two, had the salmon salad AND the jerk chicken with roasted potatoes and red beans/rice. I also ordered the sampler appetizer.\nIn summary, PLEASANTLY SATISFIED with EVERYTHING. The jerk chicken with the sampler was sooo flavorful and tender, the coating on the fried zucchini was non greasy and full of flavor, plantains delicious, and the hush puppy-like finger biscuit thingamajiggy had just the right amount of sweetness and density.  The dipping sauce especially nice.  It was sour and tangy but not like the usual ranch dressing type dipping sauces.  This was more mustard like in taste but w/o the yellow color. I'm a fanatatic for mustard and now I'm a fanatic for this stuff.  Oxtails were fall off the bone tender in a deep robust gravy, the red beans/rice were cooked just the way I like:  I've had them  many different ways but my preference- not too runny or starchy.  Full flavored but more robust than usual. Nice touch. And did I mention the healthy portion of oxtail. Not skimpy at all.  I really really liked the kale and all its' freshness.  They were probably blanched/steamed at some point to preserve its beautiful bright green color. So appealling!  I thought maybe I had tasted an ever so slight hint of butter on the kale.  Whatever it was I loved it because it was oh so slight.  As for my roomies fish, he loved it and of course, I had a taste. The dry rub seasoning was excellent not too salty.  I could taste the natural flavor of the fish as well as the seasonings. Not greasy or overcooked. The BFF finished every morsel on both plates. Wow! that huge piece of salmon on the salad  initially blew my mind.  It was beautiful sitting on top of those greens! I have to assume it tasted good since it was devoured within minutes, maybe seconds, idk I was busy digging into my own plate.  It was the BFF's first time having jerk chicken and he loved it judging by the smacking of his lips. His original plan was to give his beans and rice away to one of us since he's never liked it in all his years b4, but once his plate came and he tasted it, he knew it woulda been a mistake: he scarfed it down.  I tasted the roasted potatoes and they didn't disappoint either athough there was a piece of grit/stone in it.  In my view this is an innocent oversight because these types of potatoes can be deceiving when cleaning them.  They can easily hold pieces of grit in them even after being cleaned and not be realized by the naked eye.  I've done it at home myself a few times. They're just plain  tricky.  But nevertheless, they were good and not too salty. To drink I had the ginger pineapple- off the chain as well as lemonade for the refills- just the right amount of tang and sweetness. Everyone else had the tropical punch and they both commented how delicious it was.\nAnd to top things off, my server, whose name I forgot to pay attention to because I was was so busy getting into the food, was the sweetest.  I am a people person and she was absolutely one of the most respectful servers I have come across in such a long time.  Not to mention very attentive to all of our needs.  She smiled more as time went on as I believe she recognized our playful nature.  Personally, I think she should smile more often, guests or not, as it is so beautiful and pleasant.  And her demeanor was very endearing.  So so nice! THANK YOU to whoever you are, you made our first visit a great one, hope to see you on the next visit.\n\nAnd lastly, towards the end of our stay, a gentleman came out to tend to some plants or the gate or something on the banister and from afar he said something like, \"you gentleman okay.\" And though he was tending to the premises it was definitely a  considerate gesture on his part.  I'm assuming he had to have been  part of the management staff, but whoever he was, THANK YOU to him as well, that gesture made us feel even more welcome.\n\nSo like I said in the beginning- I had no choice but to give 5 stars.  Can't wait to come back for the curry goat.",

The portions were generous, the food came steaming hot, the ingredients were very fresh, the flavoring was delicious, and there were many veg/pesc friendly options.  I got the blackened trout, and the tofu dish - both were fantastic and the plantains were some of the best I've ever eaten.  The vibe was friendly and unassuming.  There was live music but at a reasonable volume where you could actually still have a conversation. Overall, highly recommend!",

Two of us got the curried chicken, which was very different--full of complex flavors without the heat. Totally delicious! Broadened my curry palate. I got the healing greens--which is a kale dish--as a side. Also excellent (and my first time trying kale). I would not only go back, but would drive back specifically for this restaurant.

So my chicken is now too hot & too hard! So, now I'm having jerk-y chicken. So disappointed that all the waitress did was give me a sad face. I ate what chicken i could solely bc I was starving! I even ate most of the yummy bread before I got my plate bk. The rice & beans were standard & greens very tasty. All in all, I am glad I ended my night on a good note- @ the culver hotel across the street!\nOh & the music outside was quite pleasing but the crowd outside was too rowdy & jumping over the fence. Sorry, not something I want to see as I'm \"trying\" to enjoy my dinner.

We were a little surprised but figured he was moving us not just kicking us out of our seats. so we stood there waiting for him to return, when he didn't my husband went into the place looking for someone to re-seat us. meanwhile the guy at the door seated two new groups while we were just standing in the middle of the place with a stroller... my husband returned said he couldn't find the guy who kicked us out of our seats but another waiter told us we would have to wait behind the line of people who were waiting to be seated!!! it was unbelievable so we just left.\n\nI feel I have to mention they kicked a family with a small infant out of their seats and didn't bother to re seat them, for a couple of guys who looked to be in their early 20s... now why it was more important for them to sit and not us is just beyond me.\n\nIf I had to rate the food alone I'd give this place 5 stars. I hope the manager or someone from Grand Casino reads these reviews so they can see how their wait staff treats their customers. Especially a new father out for his first fathers day with his wife and infant son. Its such a shame that I don't want to go back anymore because I'll really miss the food.",

They have a bunch of options but I always get the spinach ones.  Eggplant is pretty good too but spinach just rules all.  I've found that empanadas are a great light snack for a gathering or meeting, instead of the old go-to pizza.  \n\nAlfajores are really good too.  They're legit Argentinean style.  Not too sweet and not too buttery.  The other pastries and cookies look pretty legit South American stylezz but I'm too busy stuffing myself with empanadas to ever get that far.\n\nI only ate here once on the outdoor patio, which was pleasant.  But of course I ordered the 2 empanadas + soup of the day (which was butternut squash).  I can't not order empanadas here!!!  The server gave my friend the wrong empanada by accident and brought over 2 more in apology.  Good service all around.",

                  "review": "I live across the street and decided to finally check out Grand Casino for the first time.  Thought it might make it into our regular rotation, but didn't turn out that way.\n\nThe restaurant:  We had lunch there on Saturday afternoon.  Food quality seemed slightly above-average, but the service was bad.  It's one of those places where the waiter doesn't write down your order and then forgets to put half of it in the system.  The example in our case was a salad that never showed up.  At least it wasn't on the bill.  It took forever to get the check and pay as well.  This is at 5pm on a Saturday when they're not busy so I can only imagine what it's like during peak hours.\n\nThe bakery: More bad service!  Tried to buy a box of alfajores for $4.95 - the woman with a weird hair-cut at the cash register points me to a sign that says there's a $5 minimum for credit cards and then presents me with two options, get something else which I don't want, or she can over-charge me $0.05 for my item to meet the $5 minimum rule.  I asked, \"it's only 5 cents, is this really an issue for you?\"  She thought about it and replied by saying that she may get in trouble saying that \"they\" check every receipt - just didn't sound believable at all.  After spending a few more seconds trying to explain that it's a simple transaction that doesn't need this much attention for a difference of 5 cents, I just put the item back and left without buying anything.  I don't have time to get hassled over 5 cents!  So, either she's a bit stupid -or- she really has to deal with a overly strict owner who doesn't treat their employees well - either reason is enough for me not to go there again.  Good luck with your business.",

But, I didn't expect the potatoes to be even more salty than the bacon!  I also ordered my eggs over-medium.  But they came out 100% over-hard.  After receiving our food the waiter never came back to check on us.  So when my water glass was empty I ended up drinking my friend's water as well.  Also, a big disappointment is when the host & waiter greet you with a \"Que onda\" or \"Que hubo\" which I got both of.  I'm a 44 year old customer, not your friend outside of work.  I'll only be using the bakery section in the future.",

Nice but unpretentious and not precious either.  Worth a visit.\n\nI seem to have a fascination with this place.  As a casual eatery perhaps?  I just discovered that next door to the south is a haircut place where you can get a haircut from a student for $6.  Since I am a simple razor cut and no styling this beats the next best deals which are around $8 in Koreatown.\n\nOK what to get here you ask?  Cafe Cortado is your coffee drink now.  American Breakfast is always good.  Can't go wrong with the Empanadas.  \n\nRather blah are things like the Tuna plate, Ensalada Caprese (nothing really fresh), Picada (cubed ham, salami, mortadella, cheese and olives).\n\nSurprisingly good is Papi's Salad (roasted red pepper, roasted tomato, fresh garlic and olive oil).",

Hardly a lunch or dinner goes by that I do not accompany with a silver of dessert. As a Bakery, Grand Casino's only real rival in Los Angeles County is Portos.  If you know what I am talking about, yes, they are at least that good. The beef and spinach empanadas are their best savories. The ham and cheese croissant is also good. For sweets, Dulce de leche filled ca\u00f1oncitos  are mouth-watering cookies. In fact any of the pre-packaged cookies will result in your wild popularity at any event you bring them to.\n\nYou can also purchase from Grand Casino during the Tuesday afternoon Culver City's farmers market (cash only). This is the best time to catch them for baked goods because they have their widest variety out for sale. The quince pie is soft and sweet with just the right amount of coconut dusted on top. You will find it at their booth. You won't always find it in the bakery otherwise.\n\nIf I could give 4 1/2 stars, I would. One reason only. My boyfriend and I want to love this bakery's cafe because we love the bakery so much but we have experienced bad service there a few times. We once had a waiter who completely forgot we existed for 45 minutes. Then a month later, we had an experience where every table was brought complimentary bread and dipping sauce except our table. It's not a particularly busy cafe so the lack of attentive service bewilders me.\n\nI would like to say that they seem to have let the person who we kept getting as a waiter go...

The meat was hard and cooked uneven (one end was rare and the other was well done). The fries were drenched with oil, but I mean dripping it. After I left I checked the reviews and saw that the place had better reviews for the empanadas so I took a mental note for the future. Several months later I was back into the neighborhood and decided to get some empanadas. I ordered a beef, a chicken and a ham and cheese. I lived in Buenos Aires for 3 years at some point and I know the originals. The chicken empanada was good. Great balance and perfect dough. The beef empanada was terrible: the beef filling  was way overcooked and dry (the original beef empanadas normally drip juices, this one was really dry) and the dough was some kind of filo dough that ripped apart. The cheese and ham was in between: the cheese was not that tasty and the ham was diced, creating an uneven taste (the originals have thin strips of ham so the ham is a nice presence, not a chunky thing in the filling). Will not come back.",

From their street-side patio to their bakery cum restaurant atmosphere, you feel like you are transported to a little cafe in Argentina.  This family run bakery makes everything fresh and serves it with both love and pride.  The only downside of this restaurant is that there is only street parking (and a parking structure located a block or two away) - normally I can find a spot, though.  Their empanadas are baked, not fried, and therefore are not only sublime in taste, but also not greasy like some others.  I always have to get a dozen or so to take home!  Their salads and sandwiches hit the spot for a nice lunch or dinner.  Their pascualina is also so very yummy and their pastries are to die for!  Their bread is a marvel and works for a variety of appetizers and as part of the meal.  It's all very reasonably priced and everyone mentions how fresh and delicious everything is when I bring home treats from Grand Casino!",

Next time you spot this truck, you better stop for some mouthwatering food made by the coolest brothers - I can guarantee you won't regret it!\nSavory Chicken Poutine\nSavory Chicken Poutine",

They no longer serve Mojitos, which I feel is a staple drink and one of my go-to's. One waitress told me they no longer serve them, others have told me \"only when they have mint\" which has been never, these last few months.\n2. Inconsistent kitchen rules. You can order something during the week and the weekend chef will refuse or charge a different amount.\n3. Service has gotten worse and worse. Incredibly negligent. For the first 15 minutes they are available and checking in... after that, impossible to track down. Very long wait.\n4. One rude waitress in particular who is very pushy (on more than one occasion) about you ordering a drink if you've only opted for food for the time-being. Major turn off.\n\nSometimes this place feels like a free for all. Can only hope for better management and more consistency.\n----------------------\n\nI actually feel this place deserves more stars than its current average.\n\nPros:\nLocal/convenient (I can walk)\nOne of the few actual sports bars in the area\nI BELIEVE the owner is from Boston, so they're repping my New England roots\nAbove average bar food- some unique stuff to try\nNice crowd of people. I'm starting to notice the regulars\nFriendly staff\nTwo very different sections/bars to experience\n\nCons:\nWaitresses can disappear for long periods of time and can be hard to track down.\nBeing forced to share your table with other people if the person you're waiting for isn't there yet... especially annoying when you've been ordering food and drinks the whole time, anyway. Not sure what the usual policy is for most places, but I don't like feeling \"table anxiety\" just for getting there early to get a good seat.\nOutside of happy hour, food is a bit pricey. If I'm staying away from greasy goodness, I find it hard to order their $13 salad.\nHave had some hits and misses with strength of drinks.\n\nOverall, haven't had too many issues here thus far and will continue to come by for games!\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n6/13/2017Previous review\nI actually feel this place deserves more stars than its current average.\n\nPros:\n-Local/convenient (I can walk)\n-One of the few actual sports bars in the area\n-I BELIEVE the owner is from Boston, so they're repping my New England roots\n-Above average bar food- some unique stuff to try\n-Nice crowd of people.

The trivia announcer has a great sense of humor and keeps us patrons entertained well.\nThe daily drink specials are pretty good too. They do offer specific specials during trivia as well. With a great variety of wine, beer and whiskey, you can't go wrong. Food menu is also extensive with many choices. The sliders were decent but the standout are the tator tots. I've never had a more perfect, crispy tots in my life.\nThe staff is friendly and attentive with a smile. Really like it here!",

Happy Hour is offered Mon.-Fri. from 4-7pm. All wells drinks were $4, so I decided to order a Tequila Sunrise. The drink was really strong, which was nice but it did not make the drink delicious.\n\nI also ordered Pork Sliders (which I don't think are on the happy hour menu anymore). The sliders were mediocre. My friend's Basic Burger was better and much better value. We also got Truffle Fries to share. These were the best part of our meal.\n\nI can definitely tell this bar has a more sports bar feel. Since that's not really my crowd, it's not surprising that I didn't really enjoy my experience here.",

But there are thousands of other pubs in Los Angeles where you can watch your game AND get some good grub (i.e. SmithHouse, Sonny McLean's, Joxer's etc etc). This place is only recommended if you live in palms and don't have a car.\n\nSo I tried the chicken parmesan sliders as well as the basic burger and fries. The prices during happy hour are like most spots. But the food was probably some of the worst I've had in a long time. The burger was so dry and bland. The chicken parm literally tasted like nothing. This is some of the worst bar food I've ever had. Also, if you're sitting at a table instead of the bar, you're pretty much guaranteed no service.\n\nSo again, if you wanna catch a game and just have a drink, I'd say check it out. But if you're looking for your game AND some grub, PASS. LOL, just keeping it real.",

YUM! For bar food, it's all delicious and very reasonably priced. The Happy Hour here is from 4-7pm on weekdays and definitely worth a stop: $3 select draft beers, $10 select pitchers, $4 house wines, and $4 well drinks, along with plenty of food deals!\n\nMy only complaint about The Garage is that the service here isn't always the best, but if you're planning on watching a few games, you'll want to take your time anyway.",

Every time I ordered 12 spicy wings they would look at my like I was insane.\n\nBut in lock step with the wings becoming not-spicy the warnings have also stopped.  So it's not just me, they know they aren't serving a spicy product anymore.\n\nI would urge the team at the garage to remove this menu option, or fix it!  How it is now, is the worst where it says you are buying something you simply are not.\n\nThis has been by experience the last 2 times.

                  "review": "2 photos\nThe Garage is a nice sports bar.  We usually go for Wednesday night trivia (starts at 8:30pm).  They have some specials during that time which you can find at the bottom of the trivia sheets.\n\nThe food here is good - during trivia you can get 12 boneless wings for $6 and you can do two different sauces. I like the buffalo sauce the best and my guy likes the ghost chili sauce.  They also have meatball sliders on the trivia specials ($6) - they are super meaty and very filling.\n\nOn the regular menu the chicken Cajun pasta isn't very cajun-y but it is very tasty!  The cookie ice cream sandwich is huge!\n\nRachel S. Is our usual waitress.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this place is that depending on where you sit the air conditioning could be blowing on you and then it is freezing.  The smoking area is right outside the door so the smoke smell comes in fairly frequently.  Lastly, parking around there can really suck!",

Outside patio area has a shuffle board and a ping pong table. The games are free to play but you have to hand over your driver license to the bartender to get the equipment.\n\nFood is typical bar food and they have a good list of beers in bottles and on draft along with cocktail selections. Try the loaded chips. It's like nachos on crack. The chips are thinly sliced and you can tell they make it in-house.\n\nThe only thing that's worth complaining about is that they let people smoke in the outside patio area. Although located outside, it has an awning. Basically the smoke gets trapped into a smoke cloud and is pretty intense if you're out the playing a game and you're not a smoker.",

                  "review": "I've lived in this neighborhood for years.  Regardless of the various nuisances caused by parking and noise, it's good to have this place on the block, most of the time.\n\nThe establishment itself is divided into two parts: \"The Garage\" which is always open, has a large bar, and is made up of mostly metal and concrete.  They have plenty of TVs, ping-pong tables, etc. And a patio.  They do trivia nights back here.  Its loud.  Very, very loud.  The common inhabitant of this region is known as \"The Bro.\"\n\nThe front part, facing Motor Ave. is known as \"The Motor Club,\" and sports a classier vibe, with dark, rich wood fixtures.  Unfortunately, this part is not always open. The Motor Club also has plenty of TVs including two large projection screens that divide the room in half, each one facing opposite, which works out rather nicely when two major events are being broadcast at the same time.\n\nThe food is the same in both sections.  It's a high-end bar food, so it's pretty much the best I can remember for any sports bar.  The menu is creative.  There is a pretty good selection, which I prefer over a ridiculous overwhelming multi-page menu, like some places.  It includes many tasty and some very unique appetizers, as well as sandwiches, salads, and pretty good pizza.  In fact, the pizza is better than most of the pizzerias in the area.  The \"street tacos\" are great.  You can get them with carnitas (pork) which I prefer, or chicken, or crispy fried fish pieces.  Another unique item is their tots.  They're like soft mashed potato in the middle, with a crispy coating in the outside.  They also do a nice grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Which is always a good \"comfort food\" option.\n\nSince the food is above average, reasonably priced, and pretty quick, we often get take-out as well.\n\nThe service is usually just OK.  They get special requests (e.g. Hold the pickles, or use ranch instead of vinaigrette), wrong about half of the time at least.  And the waitstaff doesn't seem particularly happy most of the time.\n\nWhen we go there with eating as the main purpose, we choose to go when there are not any big games on TV.  The place can get REALLY crowded for big events.  That's understandable, since it is really a great place to go watch the game with friends.  The layout is clever, the food is pretty good, and there are really no bad seats.\n\nBUT... plan ahead and definitely get there EARLY.  As early as possible.  \n\n---And please be courteous to our neighborhood.  We all live here 24/7.  Children, pets, old folks and all.  Drive carefully, use designated drivers, and remember to turn off your \"bar voice\" when you walk outside.  Thank you.  :-). Enjoy.",

Go to them instead.\n\nI had a private party here for about 25 people on a budget of $1,000, which included heavy appetizers for everyone and around 2 drinks/person. Admittedly that is a decent price (we didn't have to pay to use the room itself). But perhaps because of that, we didn't get very good service. The food was prompt but the bartender had scheduled a get together with her own friends who sat at the bar in the room. They didn't seem all too pleased that my event was taking place and were rude to some of my guests.\n\nOverall this place is cheaper than some of the more upscale bars in Culver City, but simply not very good.",

When halftime rolled around, the entire bar was packed. The TVs outdoor were a little small and had a horrible glare from the sun. But when the sun went down, it was totally fine. There was also no sound coming from the TV.\n\nI ordered the kale salad with chicken (who eats salad when watching football? Sigh) and the salad was so so so oily!!! With every bite that I took, I had to wipe the oil off of my mouth otherwise I would look like I smothered lip gloss on in the dark. Someone else in my party ordered fries and complained it was drenched in oil as well. However, when someone that arrived later ordered fries, the fries were totally dry and not oily at all.\n\nI like the crowd here although I definitely definitely don't fit in. There were lots of dudes (probably because it was game night) dressed super casually in bro tanks and tattoos. And then there was me in my preppy Jcrew work outfit lol.\n\nEven though this place only got a 3 star, I will def be back to watch the games. Hopefully I'll be able to get a seat inside then.",

It can get packed on NFL Sundays, but the space is large so getting in should be easy.  Getting a seat, not as much.",

I've never had a bad thing off of their menu. The staff is hot and cold. The men I've encountered who work behind the bar are nice, warm, polite & prompt. The ladies behind the bar (I've experienced 3 different ones) are consistently really unfriendly and I think what bothers me more than anything and is a real deterrent is that in my experience they are always on their phones. It's hard to get service and forget anything inviting or polite. Once again, this is my experience and I know that the garage has a strong following of regulars so they must be treating them right! I'll keep going because, again, I like their food and drink but please put down those phones!",

This was a favorite place to go for my softball team on Sundays after our game, but as time goes on, we have started to dislike it.  The service is slower than a funeral procession, the food tastes more like frozen food rather than fresh, and the mixed drinks are inconsistent.  Multiple people will order the same drink at my table but each one will vary in strength and flavor.  If they had just one more server, or had properly trained the ones they have, the place would be so much better and I wouldn't mind the food and drink problems.  \n\nIt's too bad because the decor is cool and place has a comfortable sports bar feel with plenty of TVs.",

It's not the best burger you'll ever have but for that price, why not! I wasn't a big fan of the pizza, I almost would prefer getting Pizza Hut instead. If a heart attack is what you want, go for the Mac and cheese sandwich. Yep, you got it - it's a sandwich with Mac and cheese in it! It tastes good, but it's carbs galore!  \n\nI also tried the wings (not on happy hour menu). They've got ghost pepper wings, which were extremely spicy but pretty delicious! The Jamaican jerk were also legit.",

The men's had piss all over the floor and is slick to walk on, and again, no paper towels to dry hands. They play real crappy music that I swear is the same 10-20 songs on a loop via \"my jams\". (What r the odds of hearing Whitesnake everytime u go in?? Yes I just said Whitesnake). This is only a ploy for u to download an app and PAY for music like a jukebox (ummm, who pays for music these days, y not play Spotify or some decent playlist that varies) #moneySuckers.\n\nManager walks around brushing and pulling on her hair like a clueless lost clown, while the inefficiency and mess is in Ur face.  Waitresses even agree when u mention things but say they r ignored by mgmnt. One rolled her eyes in frustration and said 'yep, it's my last day working here\".  \nI used to manage a bar just like this back in my day and it's really not that hard to do.. they claim it's a neighborhood bar but there is no love or thought, it's clearly a corp vibe that simply ignores little things and it's patrons.  Feels like Ur rude crude grossly neglected cousins basement.  Ill b going sparingly if at all,, so much potential too, and close to home but I'm seeking a different watering hole... who owns this place? Do they care?

There are plenty of TVs to watch and about 6 or so tables back there. Didn't go into the other areas.\n\nMy only 2 complaints... 1. The power kept going out and the DirectTV kept reseting so we would watch 5 or so minutes of the game, then have to wait 15 minutes for it to reset. Happened a few times. 2. Our waitress didn't give us the time of day. Everyone else seemed like they were getting taken care of but we had to chase down our waitress or any waitress/waiter for that matter to order food or drinks. We ended up getting drinks from the bar area because it was a hassle to even get her attention. I believe she only came to our table twice the whole night.\n\nPrices are reasonable and the food is good. I'll definitely be back but I hope I don't get the same waitress.",

                  "review": "I've been here twice, and all I can say is that I've had the same experience both times.\n\nMy first time here was for a fantasy football draft.  I liked how accommodating they were to my 12-team league, as they were able to reserve for us the stage location off to the far corner, and on short notice.  We needed the wi-fi connection to enable our fantasy drafting, and for a good stretch, the wi-fi let us down.  It stopped working.  So we had to do a re-draft mid-way into our drafting.  Otherwise, everything was standard sports bar fare -- drink prices and appetizers.\n\nOn my second visit, I simply could not find a seat.  Luckily for me and my two companions, I'm bold enough to ask if we could sit with another group.  So that's we did.  But this is the place that, if you're not coming in early enough to grab seats, you're up the creek without the paddle.  So the lesson to be learned is:  Come here early for the morning games, even if you don't care for the teams playing in them, and spend more money so that you're here 6 hours.  I mean, I like beer and I like to eat, but I don't like doing either for a continuous amount of time.\n\nThe one thing that kills me is that they have a whole sectioned off room for New England Patriots fans -- a room that has more empty space than people can fill -- while the rest of the joint has people fighting for seats.  Sure, I can sit over there and watch a team I could care less to see play, and of course the owner could do whatever he or she wants with his or her bar, but I can also decide not to go.  Which is my mentality every time the place gets mentioned as a place to go grab drinks.\n\nI do like that they have some nutrition-conscious fare here, though.  I had The Garage Burger (I think it's called), that had the grass-fed beef.  I guess when you live in L.A., you're going to have that kind of luxury.  Still, the burger and skinny fries were $12 and having to eat that with one of my ass cheeks pressed up against a stranger, it doesn't seem all that desirable after all.\n\nKudos for this place being in up-and-coming Palms, but not my cup of beer.\n\n- Will",

I probably assumed it was a car repair spot.  \n\nWe came here during a clippers game, as did I think everyone else.  There are two entrances, one on Motor and one through the back.  Don't be deceived by the first room which is much smaller, a bit divey, and looks like it could be from a dusty saloon. The room in the back, though, was about twice as large (or more) and had large screens showing sports games all across the walls.  The place was packed from the post-work crowd, and everyones eyes were GLUED to the screen.\n\nThe Garage seemed a bit understaffed, as waitresses were running all over the place and seemed to be in a rush to take orders.  We ordered a bunch of food off the HH menu, including the sliders, pizza, the caesar salad (which is the BEST i've ever had and I don't like caesar salad), and a couple other things that I can't quite remember... and most importantly, $5 well drinks and $3 drafts.\n\nThis is definitely a fun place to come for a sports crowd atmosphere, and even though I'm not a fanatic by any means, give me some whiskey and many things are much more bearable.\n\nI will definitely be back as it is so close to where I am, but BEWARE, street parking is almost impossible to find during rush hour!",

I live extremely close and have enjoyed the food every time I've had it, but aside from going in and writing down what I'd like to have, it most likely won't happen. I've tried over a dozen times to order from here for pick up and maybe succeeded 5 times.  Like I said, the five times I have had the food (2 of which the order was messed up) I enjoyed everything.  I guess the owners don't bank on to go food and have the staff ignore the phone?  I dunno, just wish it was easier to get some food from here.",

I would definitely go back and of course I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice family friendly place to watch a game!\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nAli A.\nBusiness Owner\n11/2/2018\nYessenia, thanks for bringing the family by to cheer on the LAFC!

I only come to the garage for HH which is M-F 4-7pm. The first time I came about 2 months ago it was ghost town but recently it's been getting really busy. The garage is HUUGE first of all, and it includes a patio section with ping pong and shuffleboard. HH includes maybe like 5 different apps for $5 and select beer pitchers for $10. Yes...an awesome deal!!  It definitely gets crowded around 6, esp on a Friday night so get there early if you want a spot or you want to play some shuffleboard! Definitely one of my go-to HH spots.",

Khao soi is a slightly more obscure northern Thai dish so, if you haven't it before, imagine a light curry soup packed with noodles and flavor. I prefer mine with no meat and extra veggies!\n\nThe noodles here are, overall, done well so I think you'll be happy with any noodly dish.",

I did read a few reviews prior and unfortunately 3 yelp reviewer said they found hair in the food. I wanted to give the food a chance for myself. I figured that could happen anywhere. I order my food for pick (staff is very friendly) when I get home I open my food to find a long HAIR in my pad Thai. I was so disappointed and discussed. I called them immediately and they thankfully honored my refund. I showed the manager the hair and apologized. He said unfortunately he can not force the cooks to wear hair nets. Yikes! So I would stay clear if I were you. Seems to be a problem with finding hair in food. Hopefully they can make a change.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool",

The tom yum gai (soup) was good also, with large pieces of tofu in it.  The saut\u00e9ed vegetables were a bit bland, but not overcooked.\n\nThe bad news is, their online ordering is a nightmare.  They use some service called Beyond Menu which I've never heard of.  (I tried to order off the yelp website but it was too glitchy.)  I got into trouble by wanting white rice with my vegetables, which most places either provide as an included side or offer you a click option to order with your dish.  But I couldn't find a side of white rice anywhere - not with the entrees and not in the rice dishes or sides either.  So I asked in a \"comment\" to my order for them to provide a small white rice.\n\nFast forward two hours later.  My food hasn't arrived, so I check my email and see that it's been burning up with a million emails from Beyond Menus that they've been trying to call me.  My phone hasn't rung at all.  I try to call Beyond Menus but I get a message that \"the google customer\" isn't available.  I call the restaurant - they have been waiting for me to authorize a $1.50 up charge for the rice.  \n\nSo I authorize it.  Wait for a while.  No food.  \n\nMore emails from Beyond Menu.  I call the restaurant.  My delivery isn't within their 3 mile radius, it's actually 3.3 miles and there will be a $3 up charge.  \n\nSo I authorize it.  Wait for a while.  No food.\n\nI see, this time, a missed call from somewhere in Illinois.  I try to call.  \"Google customer is unavailable.\"  I call the restaurant.  At this point they don't even answer the phone by saying \"hello.\"  They say, \"yes Miss?\"  They are having trouble getting a REAUTHORIZATION FAX from Beyond Menu.\n\nSo I ask them, beg them, plead with them, to take my damned information themselves on the phone.  My credit card number, my order information, my address, my children's names - just to please fill the f-ing order.  The manager is very patient, gets my info, and finally dispatches my food.  Which arrived fresh and hot and was very tasty.  But also almost 3 hours late.",

I would personally prefer this place to Pasta Sisters Culver City location given the variety of menu items and the quality of pizza. They seem to be known more for cous cous like pasta called fregola. Given I was in a mood for long pasta, we tried Caesar salad, tagliolini alle Vongole, steak and pizza with prosciutto ham. I like this place, because they don't rely on sauces. They make the most of original taste of ingredients, al dente, meat cooked exactly how we requested, etc. It's not a fancy place, but their dishes are cooked right. We will be back to try fregola next time!",

I was searching for Sardinian food in LA last weekend, and was surprised to find that there's one right in Culver City! Carasau is one of the very few Sardinian restaurants in California - the only other one I know of would be La Ciccia in SF.\n\nWe were able to dine in as they have a nice outdoor patio, and the server was so polite and helpful. We started our meal with a red and white wine from Sardinia, and burrata with heirloom tomatoes. Then for our mains, we ordered Fregola Di Mare (seafood couscous) and the Sardinian pasta with sausage and tomato sauce. Both dishes were STUNNING. We kept trading plates because we loved both of them so much.\n\nSince it was our first time dining here, Vincenzo (the owner) treated us to some pastries and they were delicious. He even shared his story about being from Sardinia and why he wanted to open up a restaurant that serves one-of-a-kind dishes from his hometown. Such a warm and friendly guy! It was truly a wonderful experience. Carasau has gained 2 new fans!",

I had penne in pink sauce and he got some sort of gnocchi that was especially recommended by the staff. We were both very pleased. We also got some Italian beer to go with dinner.

What else can I say? The first time I ate here was shortly after they opened. The second time, the menu was slightly changed. Disappointed that I was unable to get the same salad I'd had the first time, because, as I said, delish. They said they were mixing things up to see what worked best. Everyone we have brought here has been happy with their food. Try them out, but please don't make a habit of eating here so I can still get a res!\n\nThis review was written during Covid but the dining experiences were prior to Covid. Can't wait to go back.",
